1.0,False,"08 20, 2017",A36GNVGF1CB3YK,B0167AK9Y8,M. Mielke,"Let me just say I have been a huge dragon age fan since the series first came out. I loved origins. DA2 was ok. This game got a few things right and everything else wrong.

Pros:

Improvements from DA2 include, open worlds to explore - much less linear and does not stay restricted to one freaking city (lazy ass devs).

Cons:

Bad combat mechanics. Simply not a fun game to play combat wise. Very little healing. Mages have been significantly nerf'd. Rogues are still stupid and incredibly weak and require too much micromanagement which itself is clunky and slow. Warriors are still ok, but they are hard to mess up.

Characters. 90% of them are just bland and uninteresting with very little to learn about. Dialogue is devoid of life. Half of them are just lame SJW plugs which seems forced in a dark fantasy world about the dangers of magic, demons, witches and dragons.

Quest design. In dragon age origins, side quests actually had meaning. In this stupid game side quests usually revolve around farming for specific items, playing ""treasure hunt"" x 1,000,000,000, solving stupid line logic puzzles. Very rarley in this game do side quests have any substance. Generally they are just filler to waste your time running around the map.

World design. Oh man is this a BIG one. Every. Single. World space. Is so poorly designed they are just not enjoyable to look at... specifically the Emerald Forest is just embarassing. It looks like they took about four tree models then enlarged them by 5,000% and called it a forest after a greenwashing of the enviornment.

On the PC version the LOD of the enviornment doesnt render properly so you are left with pop ins of giant trees or complete sections of the forest just disapear when you look away at the right angle.

There is no day night cycle skybox. Its just sad the level of detail that went unnoticed. Its because frostbite was not designed for this game and Bioware had no idea how to use the engine and it shows. Even though these spaces should be open world they still have invis walls (-1 star right there no matter what) and largly played quite linear.

Bugs. Oh man there was ZERO quality control on this game. My PC is an i5 6600k@4.2hhz+Gtx1070+16gb RAM+SSD+180hz gsync monitor. There shpuld be no stutters or fps drops. The game is plagued with microstutters, like every 3 seconds and in one area I get 140+ fps then the cell next to it drops my FPS to 70+ even with those high frames the drop is extremely noticeable. It lags for a split second. This happens in EVERY world space. Various quest bugs preventing me from completing quests. Questionable game physics.

Bad animations. Seriously the game animations looks like it came out in 2000. Completely static and unresponsive to enviornment or other actors. Freaking vanilla 2011 Skyrim has better 3rd person view animations than this game.

Rewards. Literally every single reward in this game is useless until you get end game gear. The gear looks stupid and generic. You also just buy / craft the best gear in the game. Boring AF.

Dragon Fights. The way combat works dragon fights are a tedious and unrewarding chore of micromanagement and positioning. You seriously spend more time keeping your party in their places because the AI is so horrendous that ranged rogues just run up to them and die. Mages and tanks just stand in fire and die without micromanagement and just let auto attack do its thing times 4. How is that fun? You know whats fun? KILLING DRAGONS!

In DAO (the first one,2009) there were super cool dragon finishing moves. Youd jump on on the dragon and thrust a sword into its skull. Brutal and badass. In DAI (the third one,2014) you cannot use finishing moves on dragons. They literally removed something that was already in place and cool for no reason other than they probably should have never used Frostbite as the engine for an open world dark fantasy game because it couldn't even do that animation right.

It's lack of features, the features that are present are recycled or borrowed from another game. The graphics are inconsistent, with some areas that look bland and simple things like water has animations from 10 years ago. The areas that are better looking still are very dated and just leave you wanting more. It has all the same bugs as Far Cry 4 with a framerate barely reaching 20FPS which breaks the immersion in the caveman experience. Clearly this game is running on the same engine as Far Cry 4 with no attempts to improve faults over previous games in the series. Laziness  and shortcuts by the developer is clear, leaving a feeling of being scammed. If any of these issues I mentioned are important to you, pass on this game. The story isn't even worth commenting on with how big of a let down/technical failure this is. Not recommended for anyone unless you think Far Cry 4 was an absolute masterpiece.

1.0,False,"01 28, 2015",A1W1ZH3GUMHZEK,B00KAED6Y8,Henry,"Don't get me wrong, the game is superb, amazing, I'm satisfied. I got it from buying GTX 980 bundled. It's NOT FREE. I paid for it. There is no such thing as a free lunch, somehow somewhere somebody is paying for it for something they want from it. If Ubi don't make a dime just giving away to the GTX 980 bundled, Ubi still get the promotion of their company. Why? even if ubisoft doesn't give it away, Jack Sparrow will let you play it at day 1 anyway.

BUT... the Uplay thing that wannabe the same as Steam is the problem. So, I highly recommend any buyers to crack it if you just focus on single player. You'll see the magic, everything else will work very smooth after you stop the Uplay. Moreover, I tried to stream it with geforce, somehow Uplay won't let me in. Other ubisoft games are ok though.

And cheaters are everywhere. There is mini games race that some people finish it in just 5 seconds as top leaderboard. That's impossible. I challenge you to do it in front of me without the help of hack or cheat code.

And now, here is the problem. The moment you send a report for support, ubisoft will NOT help you. What they will do is asking the proof of purchase and all other things as if YOU are their ENEMY. Note that the evidence that some player is cheating is recorded and provided to ubisoft. Ubisoft won't help you for making report, they will first attack you.

I recommend to buy it. BUT, with that crappy support from ubi, do NOT buy it at full price, wait for it until there is super big discount. If you still feel antsy to play it, borrow it from Jack Sparrow, and buy it later on.

Far Cry 4 is a lot different from Far Cry 3.
-You can download fan made maps for your extra games, you can make your own game with it.
-There is co-op feature that gives a very interesting moments in every game you play. However, most people play solo. Join in co-op takes you forever. I've finished the game a couple times and until today I can only successfully 2 times playing co-op in PC. It's unbelievably sad. Most of the time, it's disconnected 5 seconds. For this, Ubisoft will argue with their made up excuses of course...

Yet, just so let you know... I don't have that problem with a 64 Multiplayer Battlefield 3 & 4 by DICE. Even if the multiplayer in Battlefield series has so many problems, yet I can still play it. Up to today I have more than 1000 hrs in BF3 and BF4 each, compare to any AAA title by ubisoft games combined hours average 30 hrs per game. Ubi games Price Value is not worth 50$ imo compare to Origin give away BF3 for Free to everybody last year.

And there is no point to buy the game if the supports aren't exist.

EDIT 1:
After the patch, I can get the co-op much easier than before, it's a good try. BUT.... there is always but, why? because it's Ubisoft. The Uplay prevent me use the MSI Afterburner to check the FPS and temp of my GPU. As soon as I turn on MSI Afterburner. Far Cry 4 stops working. Forget about recording your gameplay for Youtube channel. UNLESS, you crack it. Then everything will be fine. So that means, you cannot record your multiplayer experience with the software provided by your GPU. I got Far Cry 4 because of getting the NVIDIA GTX 980. So there should be all support cooperation between Ubisoft and NVIDIA. But not at this one particular game.

Again, you call ubisoft for this issue, they just say yea yea yea, we're doing something... I doubt it will be fixed by next year. Even the game Watch Dogs graphic at the advertisement VS real graphic quality now, after long time wait wait and wait, there isn't anything from ubisoft to deliver its promise.

Don't get me wrong, I did a review on Far Cry 3, it's a lot stable than FC4. Yet it was still the same problem on Multiplayer matchmaking part of the game if you read my review. How many years was Far Cry 3 made? If ubisoft have a good intention, the multiplayer issue in FC4 should have been improved a lot than the FC3.

Still, do NOT buy it at full price. 5$-ish is the right price for this game. Why? As the comparison. Battlefield 3 was ONLY 1$ when it was fixed thoroughly by DICE, and I spent more than 1000 hours of entertainment in it, Far Cry 3 less than 50$. Maybe I should dropped the star review on FC3, don't you think?",1 star - Not the Far Cry but because it's ubisoft.,1422403200,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC Download'}",

It is highly insulting that a company that has made the highest profit margins of this generation of consoles has chosen to release a downgraded system (at a higher price then the legitimate sku can be bought at any time at Target/Walmart) that not only drops backwards compatible play with Gamecube titles from last generation, which includes some of the best software that has been availible on the Wii mind you, but they also have dropped support for Gamecube controllers and Wavebird GCN controllers in the Wii games that support them.

These aren't just average titles that are being messed with or just a handful of them either. Games like Mario Kart (a pack-in title on their good sku with well over 20 million copies sold) that many many people prefer to play using the excellent gamecube controller over the Wii Wheel option or simply the wiimote. Then you have a second absolute marquee release in Super Smash Brothers Brawl which once again a great deal of people (from my expirence the vast majority of them) also not only prefer playing with the gamecube controller but outright dislike the game on the wiimote.

Then lets not forget one of the best features of the Wii console being the Virtual Console allowing people to download games from NES, SNES, Genesis, N64, Master System, Turbo Graphics x16, etc which were all playable on the very comfortable and versitile gamecube controller with in my opinion the N64 games being much better on the gamecube controller then they are on the classic controller.

I can't really fathom the point of why Nintendo has done this to save/rob, really a couple of dollars and they couldn't even add anything to make up for it like say an HDMI port, a built-in wired ethernet solution, a simple optical output for digital sound, add DVD playback or at the very least update the built-in wifi which is still using an extremely outdated and cheap technology from nearly a decade ago.

I personally think Nintendo has been price gouging the entire generation, I think at its launch for $249 that they easily could've hit a sub $200 price and that they could've been at a sub $99 price for awhile now. I still own and love my Wii, Nintendo is still one of if not the best game developers in the business and they continue to get my money because of those games but they do by far the worst job in the entire console industry of providing value on the hardware side.

I will continue to spend my money on their products for years to come as they have software that makes putting up with their over-priced and underpowered hardware. That being said, this is absolutely not the Wii that I would recommend anyone to buy. If you want a Wii pick up one of the older models with either Mario Kart or if you can find one the Wii Sports/Resort bundle is also a better way to go.

It really is just sad that Nintendo's software development teams which are truly amoung the best in the industry if not the best in the industry are a part of the same company. It was already a bad deal in terms of what we were getting for our dollars in terms of technology for $150 from Nintendo vs what $200 or $250 get you from Microsoft or Sony.

I find this type of move even more distressing when you factor in that Nintendo has basically just about stopped supporting the system with new software with very little having actually been released on the system over the 2011 year and with just a few meaningful games still to come such as Zelda and Mario Party 9.",Wii without all the features that a Wii has always enjoyed.,1319846400,16,,

It's awkward, it's punchy, and buggy. It  restricts your creativity in a way that I've yet to experience in any other  Sim game.

I recently upgraded my PC, got a top of the line video card, and couldn't wait to try out the new engine.  Luckily, I waited till the demo came out, and ran that first.  There are two chapters in the demo.  The first is chapter one, where you (as Gordon Freeman) arrive at City 17 on a train.  You wander around a nearly deserted train station, and see some very impressive graphics and digital actors.  They still look pretty polygonal, but they are a lot more realistic than anything else out there.  Facial expressions, the whole bit.  They ain't Gollum, but still, very impressive.

There's a very eerie feeling in the train station.  The emotional impact is quite strong.  Something horribly wrong has happened, and you are in some kind of relocation station.  A PR film runs over and over telling you that this is one of the few remaining cities...  Remaining after what? you wonder.

As a big science fiction fan, I was immediately drawn in.  After encountering a bud from the first HL, I manage to escape the station, and find myself in an open plaza.  This plaza was just amazing in its photorealism.  You can almost tell what time it is just from the lighting and atmosphere--it is that real.  Soon, though, the chapter ends as you enter a building.

The other chapter in the demo is chapter 6.  Now you are much further in to the story, you've got a gun, and it's dark. There are some very impressive crows in a yard, flapping and cawing. Wow. (Sounds dull, but you have to see it.  So real!)  But there are also...lots of body parts and blood strewn around.  Corpses of people who seem to have died in extreme agony.  Skin ripped off their bones.  A torso cut in half, hanging from a tree.

At this point, I lost interest in the game.  This video world I have entered has convinced me quite solidly of its reality, and now I am presented with some very realistic, believable, stomach-turning horror.  I had no wish to be here any longer. I could not feel anything but pity for the poor souls lying dead around me.  I did not feel that killing anything that moved was going to help anyone.  I shut down the game and deleted it off my system.

If you've gotten this far in my review, you may be surprised to know I like shooters.  I just completed Thief 3.  Wonderful game.  You rely on your cunning and skill.  However, it did bother me a bit that it's ""me against the world"" in Thief.  Can't trust anybody, and there's no remorse when you have to kill somebody to achieve a goal.  What I liked about Thief more was its ""adventure"" side, more than its shooter side.

I'm intrigued by the MMOG phenomenon, though I haven't tried any of them.  But I'm intrigued by the idea that people (strangers, no less) get together in these games and cooperate to accomplish a goal.  And they enjoy exploring vast video worlds.

I think eventually we'll see an adventure game (like Myst) that is as highly rendered as HL2, allowing the interaction Myst currently lacks.  It will be gorgeous to look at, convincing in its reality, and it will have an interactive storyline (with you as the protagonist) that involves more than simply making your way through a maze (such as a building complex, yawn) filled with zombies and monsters.  You can see the interest in such a game based on the success of ""The Longest Journey"", the Sims, and the Myst series and its clones.

When I want to play, I want to pretend I can save the world, sure.  But not by shooting everything in sight.  The encouraging thing about playing this demo was that it showed the potential video games have now.  I'm looking forward to the day a developer with imagination takes this technology the next step forward.",Excessive gore ruins the fun for me,1104710400,6,,

This review may be updated as time goes along based on the gameplay experience that Blizzard may change. As for now though, the launch and current gameplay isn't worth $59.99. In fact, I waited a few days just in-case something like this would happen and I was right. They did indeed have several issues.

I am very disappointed with this game. I feel that this is rather not a sequel at all to Diablo 2. Perhaps it would be an enhanced edition of the first series: Diablo 1, but not 2. Its gameplay mechanics and features are not worthy enough to be called a ""sequel"" to the game. I don't feel any resemblance to Diablo 2, but a closer resemblance of Diablo I in this game.

Only 4 players are only allowed onto a game. Compared to Diablo 2, 8 players were allowed. I really don't think this game is intended to be a Massive Online RPG if onlya maximum of 4 players are allowed into a game. This is ridiculous. I really do hope that they increase it to at least 6 players because 4 players just feels too few for a MMORPG.

For now, don't play Diablo 3. Not when the game is incomplete or half-baked. This game clearly needs re-adjustments before it can be taken seriously by players. I'd give this game another year to fix the major problems and then see the results.

So when I found out Jillian Michaels was coming out with a balance board game I thought great, a fitness buff should bring a fresh perspective.

Well, in a nut shell what was created was not a fitness program that you can build a lifestyle around but more like a game that you can play for a few weeks and then move on to something else. The Big three as I call them (Yourself Fitness, Let's Yoga, and Wii Fit) can be incorporated into a fitness lifestyle on pretty much a daily basis. No so with Fitness Ultimatum

So just where does this game fail as far as an exercise program? For one thing, in this game you are mostly not doing the on screen exercise but doing some kind of physical gyration to get your on screen avatar to do the screen action. For example running on screen is done by alternating heel lifts and swinging your arms. In boxing in order to get permission to throw a punch on the bag your hips have to be swaying to the music.

Oh, and the music. Have these game designers ever been in a gym? I feel like I'm listening to some-one's Ipod shuffle mix. Exercise music is supposed to drive you to working out, not someones idea of good tunes. In one paint ball hand grenade activity I was throwing paint ball grenades to country western music. What???????

The game does work without the balance board. I found that out today becasue the balance board game sync menu is not user friendly, the controls are too sensitive and you don't get enough time. Thus I failed the balance board sync test and went without the balance board today

And finally the game has no exit. Once you get back to the opening flash screen the program dead ends. Yesterday the game crashed my Wii so I had to unplug to take out the disk. Today after I got to the flash screen, I ejected the disk and inserted Wii Fit. After a couple seconds of the disk turning, I got a screen message that said please insert Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009.

I was a Mario fanatic during my freshman year of highschool. Playing Mario Brothers for hours on end. I would leave the console on at night (there was no saving Marios progress) only to have to start over the next day because mom turned off the console... she just didn't understand, ""I made it all the way to world 5-3!!!"" Mario was a huge success for its time!!! There was nothing better!!! So, feeling nostalgic, I picked up a copy for my gameboy advance.

After a few hours of gameplay, I was done with it. In this day and age where games of the same price can be so much more entertaining... why did I blow my money on Mario? Its not that I expected cutting edge graphics, or changing the game (why change a classic. I would have been able to make it thru to the end if they just added one feature... just one. A simple thing like a save game feature would have given it 3 stars from me.

This is a perfect example of Nintendo recycling old games and making a bundle. No thought process went into this... it was an old idea repackaged. One thing this did for me, is made me appreciate the advancement in the video game industry. In a day and age when reviewers complain about games being too repetitive, Mario does not deserve a good review... even from those of us who grew up with PAC MAN and GALAGA.

I will agree that when Mario first hit the streets, it was the greatest thing out there. However at this point and time, Mario is definitly showing his age.

The gameplay isn't ALL bad. I mean, you do get to have a gun, and you DO get to shoot in selectable directions (Except up or down).

Heck, you can even jump through other platforms, too. So you'll have a really hard time ever beating the first level. If you do manage to get past the first level, you'll be likely to give up.

The sounds are dull. The music is a garbled 8-Bit mess. The sound effects are okay, I guess. But it's cruel having to listen to 2 beats over and over again. At least, in the first level, that was what it was like.

1.0,True,"04 4, 2009",A34I8FM285YCYQ,B001CZJOSQ,John Kitchen,"I really, really,  wanted this game to succeed.  For me.  I prefer driving cars that behave realistically rather than ""arcade racers"", so I had expectations that this would be a great next step from Forza 2.

The major disappointment for me was that if this is a ""sim"" then it is a very limited sim.  It may simulate the car physics quite well or even very well, but I expect a sim to do more than just physics.  I expect it to stimulate as many of my senses as possible to recreate as close an approximation to reality as is feasible.  Taste and smell may be taking expectations too far, but I expect good sound, good graphics and a good tactile feel.  If any one or more of these fail, the sim has failed in my opinion.

The Xbox website states that Forza 2 is rendered in 720P and RACE Pro in 1080p, which sounds really good.  Sadly, I found RACE Pro to look markedly inferior to Forza 2.  I set up two Xboxes side by side on identical hi-def screens on the same track (Road America), at the same place in both Forza 2 and RACE Pro, and the difference was obvious.  The track detail is just not there in RACE Pro, and the track surroundings are much reduced. A similar, but less rigorous comparison with Forza 1 said that RACE Pro is the better of the two, but that's to be expected in 2009

What I feel I lose with this lack of fidelity is not just a reduced feeling of immersion, but the ability to judge my cornering lines, or even know where the track is going.  Too often I found myself off the track and not sure what I did wrong.  I promise you that in the real world, I'm just not that dangerous!

This may also be in part a consequence  of the lower frame rate because at 150 mph, your car is covering over 7 feet every 30th of a second.  Forza's 60 fps halves that interval.

The game is probably optimized for driving with a controller since the manual does not even describe wheel setup.  I find that decision strange for a ""sim"".  While it is true that there is some force feedback on the Xbox racing wheel, it is very weak and generic.  To me it feels like a somewhat constant self-centering pushback.  By contrast, Forza 2's force feedback ""tells"" me lot of what is happening at the front wheels.  I can feel bumps, and changes in traction.  I can feel torque steering in high powered front wheel drive cars.

There are good things about this game, that many love.  I just can't get past the graphics that make the world seem very indistinct and vague as I drive.  I like the in-cockpit view, but that compounds my inability to see where I am on the track by reducing the area of visual information that I am getting about the track.

If you have Forza 2, drive a car very slowly in 3rd person view under a bridge and look at what happens to shadows and reflections, and then realize that when you are racing, you see these shadows and reflections on other cars on the track. They contribute to your understanding of relative positioning and feeling of immersion.

In RACE Pro, the shadows are generic.  Cars continue to cast a shadow even when they are in total shade (such as under a bridge).  RACE Pro cars do have reflections.  But they are generic moving checker-board patterns that bear no relationship to the objects at the side of, or above,  the track.  You will see moving reflections even if there is nothing to reflect.

The game is also rather buggy, but I'm hoping they can fix that.","A chain is as strong as its weakest link, in this case, graphics",1238803200,9,,

But the game is still very dull and lacks any tension or suspense. You walk through short nearly identical corridors shooting random aliens that pop out and sometimes attack you, sometimes attack an invulnerable NPC, and sometimes run from you or hide behind things. When they hide you can just walk up to them and shoot them. They won't even notice you're there. After a bit you'll come to a door that an NPC needs to fiddle with to get open. So you stand on a platform while aliens attack from all sides and you shoot them. Sometimes an off-screen alien will be hitting you and other than your life bar going down there's no indication anything bad is happening--no sound or video effects. So you have to constantly check your peripherals on these platforms. These missions are boring. Circle strafe and hold down the left mouse button, push v if they aliens get close. Then run through door. Hilariously one of the missions required that all the aliens be killed before the NPCs would continue through the door (and let you progress). I ran through the door too soon and 6 aliens endlessly attacked an NPC while I stood and watched. He shot off in the distance hitting nothing. They stacked on top of each other and smacked him a bunch. He took no damage. Neither did they. So I casually walked up to the most dangerous creature in the galaxy and watched a bit. Eventually I got bored and fired a couple of shotgun blasts into the mighty stack of aliens and they all died and me and the NPCs went through the door together.

Although the graphics are improved they are still not very good. Lighting and shadow effects do not look quite right. They added a hazy blurry filter over everything. I suspect that the purpose of this filter is to hide the low res textures. My suspicions became stronger when I came to an area that had marines trapped in the aliens nest. As I got closer to the marines the blur went away and I noticed the marines looked like a texture from a game from 2002 or so.

The worst part of the game is that it just isn't fun. I'd forgive the silly AI, 2002 era graphics, fuzzy filters, and everything else if it was fun. Or tense and exciting.

I am not the type that looks at these ""out of game"" extras as a good deal. I have too much stuff in my apartment as it is. If you do like this stuff though, you get a reasonable amount for the extra $30.  That is an end user decision.

Now the base game:

One of my friends picked up a copy of Spore.  I had not really intended to buy any games at the present due to the lack of time to play them with some others on the horizon when I will have time.  Anyway, I got to sit down and play my friend's copy (On his computer if you must know) for a bit. I won't be picking up a copy at initial retail price and here is why.

So, the game is fun at first.  I had a blast with the creature creator and creating things in this game is one of it's highlights.  The graphics are very pleasing and the creatures themselves are the best part of the game.  As others have said the hype and promises of this game over the last few years set up for a big disappointment.  I guess I was just hoping for something different.  Certain stages of the game are too quick.  Perhaps patches in the future (likely purchased add-ons from looking at the Sims) will make Spore what it should have been from day 1, but as of now, this game just isn't worth full retail price.  I bet I'd get about 12 gaming days out of it before I was bored.  Maybe a month of real time.

The game of Spore would get a 3 out of 5 alone.  Not the best game of the year, but definitely not the worst.  Then again I wasn't a huge fan of The Sims either, so maybe die-hard Sims fans will get more enjoyment.

There are a multitude of professional review sites that mirror what I am saying.  Spore could have been, and may be in the future a revolutionary game. As it is now, it fell short.

Onto the package as a whole:
A quick net search will show many articles at reputable sites about the DRM in this game.  It is exactly the same as Mass Effect which I experienced first hand and not just on a friend's computer.  SecuROM installs itself without any warning on the box, EULA, or install prompts.  What's more is that it won't uninstall when you uninstall the game.  You need to net search to figure out how to get rid of it.  SecuROM is there to gather info about your computer to look for hardware changes and then decrement your install limit.

In addition to the required Spyware you have a 3 activation limit.  This may seem okay until you actually look at what triggers an activation.  Things verified by users and EA themselves that trigger installs include.
1.) Any hardware change inside your computer.
2.) USB hardware changes.  Change your printer or get external HD..too bad.
3.) Formatting your disk. So if SecuROM itself causes issues with old versions of SecuROM which it has been known to do and you need to reinstall windows on the EXACT SAME hardware then you use up an activation.
4.) Putting a copy on your laptop to play on the road.
5.) Getting a new PC.

Uninstalling the game will not give you activations back like when you deauthorize iTunes on a PC.  As you can see it can be easy for users to eat up those installs.  In the world of PCs you never know when you may get a virus, have a hardware failure, or just want to upgrade your system.

If you do use up the 3 activations you can call EA and get more.  While this may be okay if you get free long distance, if you don't or live overseas then expect to pay the full price of the game again just to be able to reinstall.  As of now there are no international activation lines.

Lastly, Spore is a game that people of all ages could enjoy.  The issue is that your activation code is LOCKED to an account.  So if you install it on your computer, all users of that computer need to log into the same account for the online content.  People do not get their own world for creature creation.

So EA locks your key to your account and then limits the number of times you can reactivate the product.  They claim on their site that you can install it on multiple computers and not need the CD...they fail to tell you that you can't have multiple accounts.  You think they could at least give 1 per activation.  What's more is that the manual itself says you can have as many user worlds as you like, but then EA just released that this was a ""typo"".

Anyway, Spore went from a very promising game that could have been revolutionary enough to revive the dying PC Gaming market.  Instead it came up short of it's expectations and threw in spyware and unnecessary limitations that really do affect the end user.  If you are the type that never reinstalls old games and does not care about extra processes on your computer gathering info and sending it to some company then by all means enjoy Spore.  If you are like me though and frequently upgrade hardware, play old games every so often, and just plain don't like extra unneeded things running on your PC then look elsewhere.",What could have been great wasn't.,1221177600,10,"{'Edition:': ' Galactic', 'Platform:': ' PC/Mac'}",

So what the geniuses at the helm do next? They decide to make the same mistake yet again - by choosing the same DRM scheme that made BIOSHOCK, MASS EFFECT and SPORE infamous: SecuROM 7.xx with LIMITED ACTIVATIONS!

MASS EFFECT can be found in clearance bins only months after its release; SPORE not only undersold miserably but also made history as the boiling point of gamers lashing back, fed up with idiotic DRM schemes. And the clueless MBAs that run an art-form as any other commodity business decided that, ""hey, why not jump into THAT mud-pond ourselves?""

The original FAR CRY was such a GREAT game that any sequel of it would have to fight an uphill battle to begin with (especially without its original developing team). Now imagine shooting this sequel on the foot with a well known, much hated and totally useless DRM scheme that turns it into another Rent-A-Game no one wants. Were I a UBISOFT stock-holder I would be ordering my broker to ""Sell-Sell!-SELL!!"" instead of posting this...

Ever since its 7.xx version, SecuROM has NOTHING to do with ""fighting piracy"". All it does in this direction (blocking certain optical and virtual drives) is a very old, lame and already bypassed attempt that serves as a thin smoke-screen. SecuROM is, in fact, an intruding and silent Data-Miner and Root-Hijacker that is delivered by means of popular games.
That is why even the STEAM versions as well as the (free) Demos of such games are infected with it. SecuROM will borrow deep into our PC systems and will refuse to be removed completely even after uninstalling the game it came with. It will retain backdoor access and will keep reporting to its mothership.

Lately, these security concerns have been accentuated as known Trojans seem to be exploiting SecuROM's backdoor access for their own purposes. In effect, installing a SecuROM-infected game in our computer will be placing your hardware and data at risk long after having uninstalled the game.

And the latest vehicle to deliver this hazardous snoopware is FAR CRY 2 - a game crippled by LIMITED INSTALLATIONS! No, thanks. I think I 'll pass this one too.

The only people who do not care about SecuROM are, in fact,...pirates! Because cracking games ""protected"" by this contraption apparently is very easy. Every single game that was supposedly ""protected"" by SecuROM was cracked hours withing its release!
To everyone else though, SecuROM (or StarFORCE or any other hazardous DRM scheme) is a core issue that needs to be resolved before PC gaming can evolve any further. And the best way to resolve such issues is market correction.

That is why it is important for gamers to keep voting with their wallets. And as with any vote, well informed decisions are paramount in making the right choice.",THE DAY GAMING CRIED...,1224633600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

In recent years, the Tiger Woods labelled offerings got really good and had a massive online following.
This game will see the end of all that.

Now, I should have known before I ever bought a copy.  I happened to be out of town for a few weeks when this came out.
When I got back from my trip, I wanted to get a copy and get back to golfing with my friends from the old TW13 / 14 Country Club.
I was pretty surprised to see so many low priced copies on Amazon.  Less than 2 weeks after release, there were copies for $40 on Amazon.

So I grabbed one, wondering why so many were flooding the market with their recent $60 purchases.

Well, no alt shot, no country clubs AT ALL, very few courses and the general sterile / bland feel of this game have me understanding why people were dumping this title so fast, and for so little.  It is a surprisingly weak effort after going more than 2 years between releases.
There are always promises of more courses around the corner, and they have dished out Scottsdale, but that still keeps the course total in the single digits.  Granted, there are a few pretend courses, but honestly, if we wanted to keep playing pretend courses in a low feature game - we would still play The Golf Club instead of shelling out more money for this.

However, I was planning to buy D3 because I wanted a single player rpg game that I could take with me on road trips, vacation or in a flight.  So, at that moment I thought well I will probably spend $60 on D3 anyways, what is a few more dollars for WOW do to me for another year subscription.

I was wrong, had I know that this game required a constant online connection I would have not renewed my WOW subscription and spent over $70+. After I downloaded and installed it I went to play and I was astonished that I needed to log on.  At first I thought it was to validate my copy since I didn't purchase a physical copy of the game but NO, it was to play!!! I felt cheated, wronged, and misled.  I don't remember Blizzard's offer ever telling me that this game required an online connection. Your classic bait and switch, I can probably see a class suit over this issue. Besides, I don't see any real benefit to this online connection, no PVP, no guilds, no raids, etc...

I can see myself playing this game for about 1-2 months to beat it since I have a small child and I can only play 1 hour or 2 a few days a week but above all I see no replay value and no portability.

I also ran into the gear deficiency issue in Act I, Yes, Act I people!!! I didn't bother buying anything in the AH while I was playing this act so once I got to the final boss, I couldn't beat him with the crappy gear I had collected from drops so, I had to go to the AH and spend a few hours looking for items in order to beat him (buyout only auctions, I didn't feel like bidding and waiting 1 day to play this supposedly single player game).  Now, here lies a potential problem, I can only imagine this gear problem getting worse over the remaining acts and in the higher difficulty settings. Thus, my biggest concern is that I don't plan to spend real money on the real money auction house (RMAH) but I can see once the RMAH issue is up and running all the decent gear will go there and make the VMAH useless.

I was so excited, I very nearly just bought the game. I mean.... THIS IS EA SPORTS!! The same guys who've knocked it out of the park for years with MADDEN and TIGER WOODS. How, could it go wrong. Then, a friend of mine at Blockbuster warned me... ""Rent it first. You may not like it.""

THANK YOU FRIEND

Right off the bat... I don't really have anything good to say about this game. The only good thing I can say is that the IDEA OF THE GAME is amazing.

Here we go... MY GOD!! Office hours. You spend time in your office everyday... doing... whatever... or nothing... and every hour a new thing on your schedule comes up. Horribly boring. What makes matters worse... is, in your office time, you're only allowed to do 3 THINGS!!  So, if you decide to change your Depth Chart around... you can only make 3 moves. WHAT!!

Then theres the load times!! Dear god... Everytime you move to a new thing on your schedule... it loads... I'm not sure what, because each and every function is horribly simplistic.

Then you have to meet with all the coaches who's contracts are up and decide whether or not you want to retain them. It gives you 2 options to say to them... just 2. Either a welcome back or a RUDE dismissal.

Then you meet with the owner once a week. You go in the room, wait for the load time, get there and he says... NOTHING!! ""Well, we don't have anything to talk about this week. You're doing a good job coach.""

Then you meet with the coaches. You may have some ideas of things you want to say to the coaches... like, ""How are the receivers coming along? Are the rookies performing well? or is anybody disappointing?"" But, no... the conversation possiblilities are horribly limited.

Then there's the designing your look function? Which, for some reason... comes AFTER YOU'VE BEEN COACHING FOR A FEW WEEKS????  Then, you can design what you look like. From EA SPORTS, in which they've had a game like TIGER WOODS where you can literaly make your golfer look surpringly JUST LIKE YOU. The design your look feature is an embarassment. I'm BALD! You can't make your guy bald. In fact, there are only about 5 faces you can choose from. 4 or 5 hairstyles.

Then there's the practices. You go to a practice with your players and you get to run 10 plays. No more. No less. 10 plays. THAT'S IT!! Then you gotta wait for it to load again so you can go back to your office and sit again. Then, in the practices, you watch somebody do something wrong. A bad tackle or not bump their receiver at the line of scrimmage... well... WHO WAS IT!!  The graphics aren't good enough to tell which player it was... so, it gives you a grab bag of things you can yell to motivate or instruct your players... and you just have to guess who to direct it to.

So, I re-signed all my players. There were some I wasn't interested in retaining before the season. So, I was done with everything... except practices... so, rather than wait for it to load 50 times going to each OFFICE HOUR for absolutely nothing.... I went ahead and simulated past the office hours to the practices... AND THE GAME SIGNED THE PLAYERS I DIDN'T WANT TO SIGN!!!

Uggh... SCOUTING FREE AGENTS??? Another problem. So, why do I need to scout ISAAC 'Frickin' Bruce?  The game won't tell you anything about him until you scout him. The guys been playing for years... I don't need to scout him. He's played in over 150 games.

Then, after tons of wasted minutes waiting for the game to load from task to task... monotonous office hours and coaches meetings where YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SAY WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO SAY TO ANYBODY... including players, because it only gives you certain things you can say...

GAME DAY FINALLY ARRIVED!!

Yeah... horribly unrealistic. 5 minute quarters. Players marching up and down the field like defense didn't exist.

I think it could have been so much better with just some minor tweaks. First of all, there's no challenge whatsoever in the career mode. Come in last place? No big deal...congratulations, you're onto the next race. It doesn't matter if you win or lose, you just keep progessing! It might be possible to beat the game without winning a single race! Also, Turn 10 is under the impression that gamers don't like grinding, but this just isn't true. Practically every race for the first few hours you get a new car for levelling up. The free cars just keep getting better. You can easily beat the game without ever buying a single car or a single upgrade! There's something disturbing about that. What's the point of playing the career at all? They might as well just give you the grand prize as soon as you turn on the system, and save you trouble of playing! Then the game gives out an absurd amount of credits and gives 100% discounts on upgrades after you've raced in a car a few races. I played the game maybe 40 hours and had easily purchased every single R1 car in the game. There was nothing more to keep playing for. Credits are useless. And 50 free cars is absurd; my garage is full of cars I've never even tried. I want to get used to a car for a couple of hours before I'm presented with another car. I really want to recognize the difference, which I can't do when I'm switching cars every race. Another gripe is the online mode. Turn 10 believes that gamers don't like ""ghost"" mode, where you can't slam into each other, but in earlier Forza's, when the matches were exclusively designed by players, everyone did ghosts. As it is, you have to hang back while everyone slams into each other in turn one and then you have a chance of actually winning as all of the cars slide off the course. Ghosts should be the primary user mode. Also, they set up a quickmatch option where there were no rules at all and you can bring whatever car you like, so of course the only car that can be competitive is an ""X"" level car. Also, if you win, everyone else gets to vote to kick you out, which should be re-thought really.

In terms of overall design, the model for simulation racing games should follow something Gran Turismo 4, in my opinion. You get a few credits to buy a piece of junk car, you get a few prize cars here and there, and never without a lot of effort, and you have to grind for a long time to get a good car. You can switch between special events, specific manufacturer events and core events whenever you like, and all of them seem meaningful. This will keep players playing longer. The ""economy"" in Forza 4 is a disaster. After 5 hours, you can be in the best cars in the game. After 30 hours, there's nothing more to work toward at all. Forza is trying to create a culture of ""you win no matter what"" and ""you're the greatest player ever no matter what"" but I think it will hurt the series in the long run. More grinding, give me something to keep working for.",Great Game with lots of design mistakes,1354147200,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Basically, the quality of the drivers of the newer headset are not on the same level as the original HPA2/HPX, however the actual AMP used with the newer headset sounds much clearer.  Thus, if you compared both the older HPA2 with it's amp to the Z6A with it's current amp, they seem pretty similar in quality.

If you are an owner of the HPA2/HPX series tournament headset, I'd highly recommend buying the amp for the clear sound. Also, for those unfamiliar with the mic monitoring feature: The microphone monitoring is provided by the amp and not the headset.

UPDATE:  Do NOT buy this headset.  I managed to get my old HPA2s fixed and ended up using those for a while after purchasing the Z6A.

No damage, wasn't dropped or mishandled, it just decided one day it wasn't going to turn on anymore. I understand that everything has a shelf like, but under a year? That's awful. So I've got to revoke my original score and everything written below.

This wired controller is designed for the Xbox, and yes, I tested it on mine, but we'll get to that later. Instead, I wanted to focus for a moment on how well it works for PC.

The answer is: pretty darn good. If a PC game is ready for gamepads out of the ""box"" then this is totally plug and play. Because it's designed to mimic the Xbox controller, and since the Xbox controller is now effectively the default gamepad for PC gaming, it's totally seamless. Most of your modern games with gamepad support will recognize it right away.

The cord is a whopping 10' long -- awesome! -- which means it's a fine choice even for those with a Steamlink or other living room setup.

And yeah, I like wired controllers, so that's not an issue for me.

On Xbox, the experience is as you'd expect: seamless. It has all the standard features, including mic/headphones jack, analog sticks, and some programmable functions. You can control the mic/phones volume from the controller, which is a decent touch.

This is STURDY, too. It's a bit heavier than standard Xbox One controllers, which in my opinion is a good thing. I like a bit of weight to my controllers.

I'd complain about price, but that's most because I'm getting old and in my head controllers should still be $20-$30. We're way past that, though. This is the standard price now. So ...

Erm... is a keyboard a controller? Not sure. Regardless OSX doesn't have a windows button or a control panel and as far as keyboards go, doesn't use manually configurable drivers.

So I called them and asked. They said it's not a known issue and that I'd need to wait for engineers to receive a problem ticket and address the issue.

I played this game for about 2 hours, and had to turn it off.  The first 30-40 minutes were character creation.

Instead, they smack you with an angsty teenage boy as a main character!  Absolutely nothing after the character creation grabbed me.  The graphics and sound are OK.  The smidge of story that was presented seemed quite lame, and the characters introduced were completely uninteresting.

The first unit was usable for about 30 minutes after-which it locked up and made a loud buzzing noise. Subsequent reboots/power-offs would let you play anywhere from 5 - 10 minutes before a repeat.

Called and was on hold with Sony for over 1.5 hours before I gave up and called back the next day. I was frustrated at this point but I realize sometimes you just get a bad unit - stuff happens. After getting through, Sony diagnosed it as defective and shipped me a box to send it back in. A new PS4 arrived this past Thursday and to my dismay it is even worse than the one I just sent back. It worked for about 2 hours and then went into the ""Blinking Blue Light"" mode that many people are complaining about. So now I just packed the 2nd unit up to ship back and will have to wait another 5 - 10 days to get a 3rd PS4 sent.

Based on my experience as well as the 190+ reviews posted on amazon I think Sony has some serious hardware issues with the PS4. Even if the 3rd time is a charm I am not optimistic about the long term reliability these systems are going to have.

At this point I would recommend anyone considering a PS4 either go with another console or wait until Sony has released a new revision of this hardware because it truly does not seem worth the hassle or the $500 price tag.

Update:
I got the 3rd PS4 from back from Sony and surprise surprise... It does not work. This time the drive is mechanically defective and will not accept a disk. On top of this Sony customer service is just soooo bad. They are rude and don't really care if you get a working system or not. It goes without saying that quality control is also zero.

They continue to release highly anticipated content that ends up falling flat. And it's not enough that it's stretched out into 3 pieces (Expansion, Game, and Stuff packs). You can buy all three of them and still feel like they cheated you.

First of all, this ""game pack"" nonsense has completely gotten on my nerves. Obviously, 'Dine Out' should've been included in Get To Work along with the retail side of the Expansion (of course, they then would not have been able to pick your wallet for another $20).

Second of all, let's all build in game restaurants that you can simply buy and have nothing further to do with! Who's bum idea was that???
You can't chef. You can't wait tables. You can't even play hostess. I mean, how pointless! The most you can do is build a pretty restaurant, show up to it, check on tables and comp meals. That's it. Their creative team needs an over-haul because whoever screwed the pooch on that one deserves to be fired. Seriously. And as always, there's no challenge because in order to buy a restaurant, you can either use a money cheat or play the sims in a high paying career for several weeks until they have enough money to do so. Because it will be far too expensive to build a business and simply buy it. No loan system or anything. So the takeaway from this is 1) Apparently no one who owns their own restaurant can also be the chef. 2) People never borrow money to buy businesses. They just magically have the money to buy it outright. I get that this is a game, but it should at least have some aspects of reality. It's a missed opportunity at teachable moments for younger players.

Third of all, I'm sick of seeing all these things that obviously should be coupled together being spread out over all these ""packs"" for the sake of greed. Take the patio stuff pack and the backyard stuff pack for example. Both of which contain two new major items. The water slide and the hot tub (an item, if I may add, that was usually featured in the base game of Sims 4 predecessors). For $20, you would end up getting 3 new major items and basically a whole bunch of other fluff that you could care less about. Which, let's be honest, is their fullest intention. Same with Pets. They seriously made a Pet expansion for the Sims 4, turned around shortly after and made a ""stuff pack"" called My First Pet. REALLY? Does the greed have to be that blatantly obvious? At least be subtle, my goodness....

I'm telling you now. Better be ready to dish out some dough for the ""full experience"" with Seasons. Because judging by their current trend, it'll be a completely incomplete expansion and some game/stuff packs are sure to follow with stuff that should've been including with it from the beginning. Insult to injury, it's always the most fan anticipated release. So they already know

Fun fact: In Sims 4's current state, its expansion/game/stuff packs come to a rough total of about $550 not including your local tax. (this is assuming you bought the base game and all the expansions when originally released, as they do decrease in price). But onto my point, can anyone honestly tell me they feel that this simulation game (with its elementary graphics), even expanded, is worth half a freaking grand?

Lets start out with saying I thought the whole DRM issue on Spore was blown way out of proportion, and the game was still good and fun and for legit use the DRM wasn't that big of a deal.  This is different.  As others have already pointed out, you are buying this physical cartridge in order to play through the game *ONCE*.  It doesn't matter that you have the cartridge in your hands, Capcom has decreed that you are a pirate and that you must pay $40 every time you want to replay the game you bought from them.

There is *ONE* save slot, and it cannot be erase under any circumstances that don't void your warrenty on the 3DS (aka using a hacking device).  One.  The stated reason is that Capcom doesn't like the fact you could play the game, get bored, sell it to someone else, and then two people have played the game with Capcom only making money off of one of them.  They are actively trying to kill the used-game market to help line their pockets in what is already one of the biggest industries on the planet.

No.  No dice.  Its my game, and if I decide I want to pick it up a year or two from now and start over from scratch, that is my decision.  Once Capcom has my money for the cartridge, what happens to it after that is none of their business.

And before anyone tries to jump me for leaving a review for a product I didn't buy, or for not reviewing the game itself, I would like to point out that this is not IGN.  It is not Gamespot.  It is Amazon, and we are reviewing the product being sold as a whole, and the DRM on this game is part of the product.  I don't need to buy the game to know that this is an industry damaging event, and to believe that Capcom *NEEDS* to be punished for this in the form of this game failing miserably in the sales department.

I'll just list all the problems:

1) Red lights of death a month into ownership, after not having so much as scratched it and with moderate use.  Talked to Microsoft then had to send it into them.  Took 2 months for them to send me a refurb replacement.

2) from the moment I got the replacement, my game discs would not load correctly one third of the time, for which I have to eject disc, manually reposition, then re-insert.

3) Halo 3 map pack which I purchased separately not loading, except for one day (7 on the 7th for those who played Halo 3) of the month.  After hours of trying to figure out problem on the phone with MS reps, no resolution.

4) Xbox controller sticky analog shift only 6 months in, still no fix

5) Windows media player unable to sync

6) Not all codecs for Video Player downloading

7) Netflix requiring you to manually input your username and password each time you log in because I used a different Netflix account to log in initially (this only happens on the Xbox). Extermely annoying.

8) LOUD fan.  So loud I finally had to put it behind my bureau and cover/surround it with blankets,pillows just so the noise which is still loud is bearable.  Then it overheats and I get one red light of death (only one Microsoft?)

Each of these problems required scouring the Internet for possible solutions, talking to MS reps on phone, then physically attempting to fix the problem if applicable.  MS reps are completely oblivious, takes at least half an hour to wait and have to explain the problem before they even understand what the problem is.  In addition, when my Xbox Live subscription expired they attempted to do a bait and switch by first offering me 1 month for $1 and then another year for $20 on phone, I learned later it was $30 and they of course had no record of the conversation and talked as though *i* was the one who tried to ip them off.

On the plus side, the urban feel of the level design is a nice change from the rest of the series where the developers focused more on ancient ruins, canyons, and forests.

My hopes for this one fell short as well.

It seems odd to pay more for a Wii version and wind up with far less than I have in my yoga DVDs.

For example, the instruction and cueing just wasn't there to take you through pose to pose correctly. You are supposed to go through the story mode for training which is extremely slow and laborious, memorize it, then do the routines apparently without looking up at your tv as the verbal cues just aren't there to walk you through it well otherwise. This can especially be an issue if you are a beginner as some of the poses are those that are in my advanced yoga DVDs yet you get no guidance when doing them here which could end up actually doing more harm than good for you.

I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn. This allows me to not only measure how many calories I burn throughout the day, but also during a specific workout as compared to other workouts. I mention this only so you know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than perceived exertion. Yoga doesn't typically burn as many during the workout, but I usually see a rise during the workout and a boost in my metabolism long after it's over. This didn't happen for me here. There were so few poses, no warm up, and so much less than I get for a routine as compared to a yoga DVD that I may as well have just been stretching and bending over doing laundry...I would have gotten better results, laundry done, and more of a burn. :-)

I loved the settings and that is why I felt the game would have potential. But in reality, it's far more basic than I ever would have guessed, both in the instruction, cueing, guidance, poses, and graphics as well. Far less than in most Wii games/fitness workouts.

I'm not hard to please if something is basic as long as I get results...that is, afterall, why we choose a Wii fitness module over a ""game"" where we stand still and move a wiimote. However, this one will be given away...it offered no ""wow"" factor to motivate me but, worse yet, the results measured were rock bottom...

I held off from buying it,the forum is already filling up with posts ""well that was a fun 2 hour long expansion"" . . . what expansion pack takes a whole 2 hours to master? that's just pathetic.
and In B4 ""nice story bro, now go do torment 999999 difficulty"" , meh whats the point?

Points:
-The loot is the same just bigger #'s its the world of warcraft scheme, its not the diablo scheme, because if it was the diablo scheme level 40 items would be viable at end-game, power of items is relevant to rarity in diablo games, not Item Level, but this isn't a diablo game so...
-The areas are the same on act isn't enough to make up for the 2 years + vanilla flop
-The monsters are the same
-All that changes is ""bigger health bars""
-Adventure mode is just farming the same areas you farmed in vanilla, but now for useless shard tokens to save up and buy crap yellows.

Crusader is nerfed into ground, all the mobility cooldowns are like 30s long, slowest clunky class in the game.
The game is the complete opposite of what a diablo game should be.
What went wrong with the expansion and Diablo III in general:
1) long cooldowns for every useful ability, diablo was never about long boring cooldowns, it was about button spam and hack and slash -Mistake 1
2) boring farming for blood shards, since when is diablo like wow where we do daily quests to farm for tokens to buy gear?
Mistake 2
3) Adventure mode ""welcome to adventure mode, the mode where you play just like you did before in the same areas you did before, but GASP you don't have to press create game"" pffft Mistake 3
4) No competition , ladders were announced (again) and you can expect them, ...around the time of the next expansion pack probably, you probably won't see any real pvp mode either till the next expansion, if ever.

1.0,False,"12 23, 2007",A8IRV370GT4JW,B000W5Y49G,The Outrage,"This product is terrible.  It is poorly designed and a pain to use.

Design problems:

The stock itself is too small for most adult hands.  The spacing of the fore and aft grips isn't very deep.  This will put your arms into an uncomfortable position for playing.  The trigger is located on the front grip.  This is completely counter-intuitive.  This will force you to either hold the device in an unusual way or operate the trigger with your less-dominant hand.

You are forced to ""assemble"" the controller before use:

Remove a cover plate
Lock the Wii remote into the forward portion of the stock
Unlatch the Nunchuck cord holder (which is very flimsy)
Insert the Nunchuck
Feed the Nunchuck cord under the stock
Wrap the Nunchuck cord inside the stock
Relatch the Nunchuck cord holder
Cover up the wrapped Nunchuck cord with the cover plate
Feed the Nunchuck cord to the Wii remote
Figure out what to do with the dangling Wii remote's wrist strap (Nintendo doesn't provide any mechanism for this)

After that process you can finally use the glorified Wii controller mount.  Was that worth your effort?  No way.  Placing the Wii's controller in a gun-style stock is nonsensical.  Your sighting down the device in no way relates to the reticle's placement on the screen.  This is a limitation of the Wii's sensor bar.  It's a one-size-fits-all affair so it can't be calibrated very precisely (besides top of the set versus bottom).  The top (face) buttons on the Wii remote are impossible to use while the Zapper is in normal use.  You will have to hold it in an awkward manner to operate them.  The transposed ""B"" button (the trigger) seems cheesy.  It is sloppy in feel.

The pack-in game:

Link's Crossbow Training is a snore.  It's a very shallow target shooter.  The design is a direct rip off of Twilight Princess.  The levels don't even appear to be changed significantly.  Nintendo put the least amount of effort into this ""game"" as they possibly could.

More Wii shovelware:

This is another example of a company trying to cash in on the Wii's popularity with another sub-par product.  Avoid this like the plague.  It has no redeeming qualities.  You can actually be more successful at shooting games using the standard controller.  This only impairs your abilities.","Horrible hardware, Nintendo cashing in...",1198368000,18,,

I put 3 days worth of total play time into the game and prestiged 4 times trying to give it every chance I could; however I have already gotten rid of it along with the friends who wanted me to buy it. Basically you pick any of the SMG's in the game and I mean ANY of them and you win the game regardless of skill of playstyle.

There is also a game mechanic (we thought it was a glitch and after tons of experimenting we found that it works 100% of the time and after interviewing multiple people who said the same it had to have been coded in) where when you are aiming down your sight and you begin to fire at an opposing player, the opposing player not only doesn't have to ADS but they can just pull the trigger on their weapon in the direction of you character and the recoil combination of them getting shot and firing back will kick their rounds into the head of the player attacking them. This results in the opposing player surviving and getting an instantaneous head shot kill with the first round to hit the target.

Beta was good, but I found out that if you don't have playstation plus it's basically a crap game. How I know this, I just played the actual copy of the game, there is barely anything to do in single player. No story mode, just training, survive, and something they put in called battle (which has several levels but only really works for multiplayer. Doing it by myself I was bored). So, that's all there is for single player. Nothing else. They stuck everything that could possibly be good about this game in multiplayer.
So, guess what, you pay a huge amount for the game, and then you have to keep paying to actually play anything. Don't buy it, it's worthless as is.
I seriously can't believe the new game creators could make a game this bad.

Final note: I have always, when I rate games on amazon rated games really well or 5 stars. I've never given a one star review, just to let you know. So, do not waste your money on this. I have a bookcase full of games, this is the worst battlefront game ever. Five stars on graphics, 1 star on single player gameplay. I'm not paying to play a game I just paid a huge amount for, it's nowhere near worth it. I bought Assassin's Creed, that was worth it. So, please go buy something like Fallout 4 or Assassin's Creed, you'll get more fun and awesomeness. All they pretty much allow you to do with Battlefront is run around on multiplayer, you get nothing to do on single player basically. I can't believe I was jacked after the beta test now. I hope the producers for this game lose a huge amount of money. They owe the fans big time for this game. I suggest they throw in free DLC's for single and multiplayer to compensate for their extreme lack of content.

On that note also, for content, could they please make the main screen look a little more ornate. It looks exactly the same as beta. I liked beta, but the point of beta is to expect more and be cut off from a lot, not find out it's the same in a lot of areas. I'm glad they improved in some areas, but this game is an ultimate fail. I've never played a game this bad. EVER.

Edit: I've now had this game for a long while ago and it's literally taken up until July to come out with some offline content for the game that looks worthwhile, as it's Walker Assault and, I can't remember the other mission but it's where you fight with X-Wings and Tie-Fighters in just a ship to ship battle.

Now the fun part, I tried both of these to test out how great it would be. Honestly I'm not too impressed. I remember playing Star Wars Battlefront 2 and you'd play battle levels like these, and it felt more realistic, and you had a certain feeling as you played, a drive to move forward, to keep going. It's funny that EA who makes the game when they released these two offline modes I believe said we've added story levels.

""Oh really? Sto-ry le-vel-s. Is that what you call these?""

All in all this has been the worst game I've seen from EA, and even with all the months EA has had to add content to help the game get better they've added very little to impress. It's utterly pathetic, having one of the best game industries in the world create something of the lowest class of game, with just good graphics to make it look good and an immediate exciting air to attract people. It's got a knack for advertising I'll give it that, but it's not a game worth buying, and don't buy the season pass, it's really not worth it.

I would say buy another game but sadly for the moment I'm in the same boat others are and there's not a ton of good shooters right now, we have to wait.

I have many gripes for this one and I'm writing this review only two days after it was released.
First off, Where is the screen where you can input codes like ""win fights for goals"", ""no puck out of play"", and my all time favorite, ""unlimited turbo""?  Yeah, some of them can be accessed through the options menu but not the good ones which I've come to love...and the game blows without them.
Secondly, I started playing a francise mode game.  Played a few. Won a few. And, you guessed it...lost a few too.  After a while, like any other normal human being, you get a little weary of playing.  So, the million dollar question...What do you do??  Very good, you save the game.  The next day I decide to go and have another shot at the game, to see if I like it any better than my first impression.  NOPE.  I come to find that my game never saved properly and had to start fresh all over again.  Nice, huh?
Third, the gameplay isn't as fast, or good for that matter.  It isn't as easy to score, the big plays that should don't, and the ones that shouldn't do.  The puck, cpu players, and even your own player don't react as well as the did in 2002.
Next, the game crashed on me a couple of times already.  Not just that, it's slow as hell loading, not as it's booting up, just when you're fooling around with jersey colors or checking out some of the rinks and things of that nature.
I could probably go on and on about my dislikes of the game here but I think most of you will get my point.
In my opinion, THIS GAME [is not good]!  Most games following in a series try to take a couple of steps forward with each new installment.  This one fell back about ten miles....or more.

I have bought the full version of every blizzard game ever made. I was one of the 1,000 beta testers of Diablo II. I bought the collectors version of world of warcraft and diablo 3. I WAS a fan-boy. I think the activision/blizzard merger and sloughing off of their original team has obliterated the spirit of this company.

#1 COMPLAINT -IMPOSSIBLE & CHEAP DIFFICULTY-
Diablo 3 has been a horrible disappointment for me. In hell mode, not even inferno mode, with max gear bought off the auction house, I die in 1 hit from normal mobs. I am a witch doctor. This game is supposed to be a hack and slash. Hack and slash should be somewhat laid back, even in harder difficulties, like Diablo II was. Granted it should have hard moments, but you shouldn't hit a brick wall every 2 minutes, that is if you can even get past the first brick wall. There are so many countless ways for mobs to kill you instantly. Instant death is around every corner. It makes the game a horribly painful experience. And the instant death is often quite cheap. For example a mob can pull you to them from across the screen and 1 hit you. A mob can die, and when they instantly explode on death which instantly kills you, which is especially horrible for melee classes. They can put up an impenetrable wall behind you, and a laser that rakes across you, killing you instantly. Some mobs run twice as fast as you and 1-hit you. You cannot esc quit. There are no counters to these things. It doesn't matter what your skill level is, you will die, and die, and die. In multiplayer games, players simply drop out when there are mobs like these. You will not be able to do a play-through of an act in later difficulty with the same players because death is so frequent people simply give up.

-HOPELESS HARDCORE MODE-
In hardcore mode you will be lucky to make it past nightmare difficulty. I wouldn't even consider making a hardcore mode character. In Diablo II I had a couple level 90+ hardcore's. That was the main reason I was looking forward to Diablo III, all the fun I had in tense boss fights hoping I wouldn't die with my hardcore character, but if I did starting over was still fun. With Diablo III, you die so much it's pointless to even try. It's not fun at all, just 100% guaranteed death and disappointment because you know your death will be based not on a miss-step, but on an undefeatable foe.

-CHINESE BOT-FARM AUCTION HALL-
Auto farming bots that farm gold 24/7 have already inflated auction hall prices into the millions of gold for a single item. A mob will drop around 100 gold in hell difficulty, and take maybe a minute to kill since it has to be kited so you don't get hit. So if you are a legit player, you are basically out of luck unless you are willing to pay American dollars for pretend gold from China. And blizzard gets a whopping 15% cut. Blizzard succeeded in somehow making the problem of Chinese gold farmers even worse than it already was, and also succeeded in coming off as just another sleezy game company that doesn't care about game balancing or the spirit of fair competition.

-CONCLUSION-
This is not the laid back and enjoyable hack and slash that hardcore-hell-mode diablo II was, this is a real life nightmare that you can only wake up from by not playing the game.

This game is hemorrhaging customers and fans, and there is a reason:

1) Atrocious customer service
2) Minimal endgame - its a joke
3) Theme-park style game play
4) Gestapo-nazi-esq forum moderation to hide the truth
5) Game engine is a 3rd party pile of junk. The fact it still running DX9 when DX11 is already out pretty much explains everything. Game engine is unable to handle more than 50ish people in a shard/instance etc and thus must be split up (even in fleet)
6) Economy is non-existent
7) Arcade on rails ""space-battles"" is a sick joke
9) Dev's are clueless and disconnected
10) PVP is a joke
11) Crafting is nonexistent
12) Classes are completely imbalanced

There are so many ways to compare this to the big elephant that is WOW, but this game just falls flat on its face. And don't even bother dealing with customer service, or point out problems, because you WILL BE MODERATED. Its a massive BW/EA coverup really, to hide how bad the state of this game is.

1.0,True,"02 14, 2015",ATP6WW8SEH3ZX,B00J48MUS4,BP66,"First off, I waited to get this game since I usually wait to pay about half price but also because of the amount of problems that people said were there at launch so this review is after a lot of the launch problems were gone or at least should be gone.

The good parts of this game are the story, the architecture is pretty awesome, and the main character is likeable which has been the case in all except AC3, but other than that the game is a disappointment with nothing new, a lot of problems, and a lot of old aspects of previous games not included.

Problems:

1) The movement is glitchy.......and even when it doesn't glitch for the amount of running that you will do the movements are slow and labored......A faster movement system even if it is unrealistic is preferable than a slow one with unresponsive controls

2) Combat glitches....variety of them including none of the buttons responding

3) Disjointed side missions.......No continuity, each side mission is it's own quick mission that is easy, mostly negligible rewards, and most of the time can't hear or don't care what the point is......Really no point to do any of these unless you really need to get money which is easier to get by upgrading the base

4) Co-op Play.......If you don't have PS plus than you can't upgrade Arno all the way (I do have PS plus) as you need to play these missions to get him fully upgraded........Forces you to play with other people instead of letting you play a normal  single player campaign.....Basically these are the missions that should have been single player side missions in the game

5) You don't get to build a network of assassins to send out on contracts or missions which wasn't a great part of the other games that used this but is something that could be really cool if they made it more detailed and improved.......and it was at least somewhat interesting to have in the old games that had it

6) Micro-paying scam........not going to do it myself but just the fact that it is in the game is annoying........not rationale but I know other people who feel the same way about buying a game and than being asked to pay more into it, on top of the DLC if somebody chooses to buy that also

7) Numerous and long load times.......self explanatory but get ready to wait

8) Chests and Cockades........many of them with very little reason to collect

9) Enigmas.........These are nowhere near as fun as the Templar vaults or whatever they were called in the Ezio games (I think they were in the second Ezio Assassin Creed game).........Pretty much collect vague clues and try to remember what buildings are what or search the cluttered map for a name and click eagle vision and wait for the cool down to finish

10) Vantage points...They made these more interesting at some point in the series where some were/attached to Templar bases, again something that should be expanded on instead of thrown away

*****11) Your are in the French Revolution????.......Literally very little has happened to coincide with the historical even, I am on sequence 8 of 12 so maybe something later in the game makes the connection, but this late in the game and it has very little impact on the game........I had the same problem with the AC3 as you pick the setting and than your character is doing his own thing instead of making him influence the history etc etc

From Alpha to Beta and then back to Alpha.  Maybe back again if enough myrmidons stay subscribed to finance SOE through this rocky period.

A very nice pistol, the ""Trandoshan Hunting Pistol"" which was a quest item included in this expansion as a special quest item that could be used until it decayed, was broken, or was sold made for a very nice Jedi hunting weapon for Bounty Hunters.

What has the new patch changed in the previous statement?

1.) The ""Trandoshan Hunting Pistol"" is no longer useable by Bounty Hunters but instead now by spies.

2.) Since it was a biolinked weapon you cannot use it unless you want to be a spy instead of a Bounty Hunter.

3.) It's irrelevant anyway as the pistol now does the same amount of damage as every other pistol in the game, negating the 30 - 40 minute quest that it takes to get the pistol.

4.) The pistol no longer decays so you can use it forever - negating the crafting economy in the game.

5.) You can no longer hunt Jedi in the game - and Jedi are now a starting profession that 90% of the players are playing as.

I described a single quest item that I received from a quest I completed in the Rage of the Wookies expansion.  I've given you 5 things that were immediately negated about it by the latest patch called the ""NGE"" or ""New Game Enhancement""  (90% of my collected items had these new 'features' that ruined them and the time spent collecting them.)

The insulting thing is that SOE has gone back to the drawing board with SWG trying to make it a copycat of WoW in order to (they hope) compete in the long-term.  They hope that you (the paying customer) is such a Star Wars freak that you will continue pumping money into their Alpha-Test of a game in order to finance the development of what they hope it will eventually be.

As-is things are horribly broken.  Medic is the strongest class in the game and a level 30 medic can solo-kill 4 level 80 player Jedi.

The game is upsetting to many because the original dev team working on SWG had a vision, and many people knew that vision and stuck with the game for so long in the hopes that it would be realized.

SOE seems content to head in the direction of what their ""WoW playing focus groups"" tell them they need instead of what the players have asked for.

To get the same effect, slam your head into your computer desk repeatedly to the tune of John William's opening Star Wars theme and flush $15 down the toilet once per month.

SOE has ruined the potential that this game had - and is running in the opposite direction from where they should have been.  They blame everyone but themselves.  It's captivating as a car wreck to watch - and upsetting for those of us who knew the game's potential.

Most and the majority of people buy and play these mmorpg games for the PVE elements, even Guild Wars massive population is PVE based though some do delve into the PVP aspect, but, and this is a BIG BUT, pvp is by choice and not forced and that must remain with all mmorpg games present and future if they want a massive subscriber base.

The negative reviewers seemed to mostly go on and on about how complex the game is. ""Sure whatever,"" I thought to myself. ""Those people are just 80-year old grandmas who don't even know anything about video games."" Boy, was I wrong!

First off, let me be clear. I'm a big fan of the first two Lego Star Wars trilogies, plus the Indiano Jones Lego game. I've also played Lego Batman. Those games are AWESOME. My two kids and I love them, especially the Star Wars ones. So with Lego Clone Wars, I hoped we would have just as much fun. But the game isn't fun.

The original Star Wars Lego games are a blast. They are relatively easy. You fight your way through areas, do a few simple puzzles every now and then, and unlock guys. If that's what you are expecting with Clone Wars, let me disavow you of that notion right now!

In this game, they have SERIOUSLY upped the difficulty level. The gameplay mechanics have also been made significantly more complex. The puzzles have all become a lot harder too. Gone is anything easy to figure out. I'm a veteran gamer, and even I was struggle to figure out what to do next in this game, even on the beginning levels!

Also, level objectives are now much more vague. Oftentimes, we couldn't even figure out where we were supposed to go or what we were supposed to do. This has made the game more challenging, but not in a good way. It has made things confusing. I chalk this up to bad game design.

Another thing I don't like is the ""busy-ness"" of the graphics. The other Lego games have clean, simple graphics. Where most of the things you see are made out of Legos. Here, it is not the case. Everything has been replaced with more realistic-looking graphics, like something you might see out of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III or Battlefront. The Lego characters interact in this realistic-looking environment, and the effect is really jarring.

Something else I hate in this game are the bosses. The bosses in the other Star Wars games are relatively easy affairs. Fun to play, especially for kids. Not in this game! The very first boss we fought, it took us about half an hour to beat. In Clone Wars, you don't just fight bosses. You have to do multiple varying things to beat them. The whole time we were playing, I just kept thinking to myself, ""You have GOT to be kidding me!"" I mean, what the heck are we playing here? Ninja Gaiden???

All this may be okay for a teenager. But it is not suitable for little kids at all. There is NO WAY a kid will be able to play these games on their own. You'll have to do everything for them.

I am really disappointed, overall. In an attempt to add depth and complexity to the game, the programmers forgot who the game is for: kids. They may be patting themselves on the back for their cleverness, but I think it stinks.

In conclusion, if your kids are Star Wars freaks and just have to have this game, then by all means, buy it. But it may not be the game you expect. Don't say you haven't been warned!",Disappointing,1338508800,22,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

After the initial part of the review, I will discuss the main reason why I gave this game 1 star which is the Broken Mechanics.  This is also what the pictures and video themselves relate to.  Other big issues with the game are its Online Component and Design.

Graphics:
Okay, okay I'm not a graphics type gamer where its end all be all, but let's get real; the game looks around the same quality as Tekken 5 which was released back on the PS2.  To be honest, King of Fighters 14 does looks better but the fact that this is actually comparable is not...a good sign.  Not a huge deal for me (gameplay is most important for me), but the fact that the PS4's ability is SOOOO underutilized is quite distressing and the fact that it is not at all aesthetically pleasing to look at some of the characters who look bland and washed out.  Some may like the graphics, but this is an eye of the beholder thing I guess.

Music:
Not a fan.  It's some very weird brain scattering j-rock that hurts my ears, especially the main menu theme.  Seriously just listen to it for 4 minutes.  It's an incredible step back from the previous sound tracks.  Especially the Esaka theme which sounded godly awesome in KOF 12 yet sounds way to cheery with way too many light overtones KOF 14.  I advise anyone to listen to the difference of the two.  Anyhow some are nice like the Art of Fighting Theme or Athena's seem to fit and sound nice.  Again, music like anything is up to the eye of the beholder, but in my opinion the music in KOF 14 is nothing special.

Content:
Okay the game is fully fledged and on release woot!  It's got a story mode, trials, time attack, Survival, lots of customization, replay vids, and more!  It's nice to see a game come fully packaged at launch for once!  Unfortunately this is pretty much where the good stuff ends.

Online:
Alright so this is, bad.  The main reason to play any fighting game in my opinion is to test your metal against players around the world.  Unfortunately the netcode in this game is beyond bad.  One out of five or so matches will feel like your players are moving in molasses.  If an opponent rage quits the game can freeze which can hamper your game records such as matches completed.  Other smaller issues would be the game boots you back to the main menu half of the time when searching for opponents.  Not a big deal but after hitting the search button for the 20th time in a row it gets old fast.

Design:
Why couldn't they just have the game keep searching and let me decide when I want to back out?  To top it off one thing a lot of new fighting games (even last gen) now have the option for the player to receive online matches ranked or non ranked while doing other things like practicing on a dummy, playing story mode, etc.  This is bad design and if KOF 14 wants to compete with modern fighters it really should ""modernize itself"" a bit.  To top it off SNK thought it would be a great idea to include a button mash button (SQUARE) or known as the ""Rush Down"" technique that if hit over and over the player can take his/her opponents health down by 1/6 or even 1/5 depending if meter is present.  This is just an absurd addition and design choice so that players that are new can just spam one move over and over.  If you want a fighting game to relate to the general populace more have a better tutorial.  When going online people literally just run at you spamming this crap, and it wouldn't be so bad if the game's own mechanics weren't broken or laggy online.  Worse yet is that the input lag can be up to 6f.  Just unacceptable.  The AI is no prize winner either.  Okay at level 3 the AI is simply bad and just stands there, not kidding.  At level 5 (max) the AI is barely passable and feels like easy mode.  Just wait for it to do an unsafe move then unload rush mode on it.  Even at this stage the AI will occasionally...just stand there.

Broken Mechanics:
Okay, so this is the main reason why the game lost so many stars in my review: the game mechanics are broken.  I know what you're thinking but it is real.  At first when playing online I got the feeling I couldn't block or hit opponents accordingly, and I thought that maybe this game is different.  After all, sometimes attacks that appear to hit high actually hit low and vice versa or even mid range.  I decided to go over one of my previous matches and lo and behold I found out the game doesn't follow its own rules.  what I found was quite disturbing.  In the game itself it says command moves such as Kyo's overhead kick known in the game as ""Ge-shiki Gofu Yo"" should hit mid range and should be ""UNBLOCKABLE WHEN GUARDING LOW"".  Please see the first two pics.  However in a match this did not happen at all and in fact I lost a ranked match due to this and probably a lot more since finally catching on.  After double checking in versus locally I found that indeed Kyo's overhead should break through a low guard as described by the game's tutorial.  If you look at the third picture captured in game with the key data present you can clearly see that my opponent on the left (Terry) was guarding low (notice the blue light indicating a block) and nothing else going on but this should not have happened as the game clearly states itself that Kyo's overhead kick should break through the low guard if nothing else is going on.  In the fourth picture after several key presses I show that my opponent does a correctly timed GC BLOW BACK move on me which is legit and nothing wrong here and is just here to help show what is happening in this small time frame. In the fifth picture I show what is SUPPOSED to happen (notice the white/red flash indicating damage).  I've also included a video of the entire incident that goes slow mo at the point of the problem. This is not just happening with Kyo either as lots of other character's command moves are not hitting appropriately.  So at this point, either the game decides randomly when to apply it's own rules as a result of lag from netcode, lazy developers forgetting to code probably, or it is most likely a combination of all of the above.

Conclusion:
Because the game is unplayable due to the atrocious netcode causing molasses style gameplay, freezing, and other problems in account with the broken mechanics I can't honestly give this game a good review.  Bad Graphics, a lackluster story, and ear splitting music don't help the score either.  With the AI being really bad as discussed along with the broken mechanics and often unplayable netcode all you can really do in this game is trials, but if you can overlook all of that which...is a lot to overlook I guess you'll have a good time.  The sad thing is that I really like this game, when it works.  I've heard there is a netcode patch that is coming but until it comes I would recommend people to think carefully before buying this.

Half Life 2 is a sci-fi/first person shooter that follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman. And by adventures I mean, shooting stuff and being denied information about what's going on by everyone. Of course you can infer a vague aliens took over the planet plot in the first 2 minutes, and the inference is about all you'll ever know. Cliche ridden sci-fi ambience aside, the real problem with Half Life 2 isn't the monsters in game but the monsters in the programming.

You see, when it came out there was a bug that seemed to randomly hit people. The bug caused stuttering with sound and hitches in gameplay, even on high end machines. The bug STILL exists and shows up in Source licensed games. I can only be confounded at how a development studio which as much money as they have can't make a stable game. id can do it. Crytek can do it and beat the pants off everyone else's technology. What's up with Valve? Aside from the infamous stutter bug, there are the load times that don't make any sense. Load times that are as if you're defragging your entire HD each time, it takes so long. How do you play a game under such maddening intermissions taking you out of the action? This is a problem that also has NOT been fixed despite Valve's ability to update their game. Add in the sloppy jalopy that is Steam, a piece of software you are forced to run to play their games, and I am utterly fed up with Valve's software practices. They just aren't up to par.

The last point I would like to bring up is the level design of HL2 was a joke. It was linear. As in, well a straight line of gameplay. It's almost shocking, like, am I playing Star Fox? Am I playing a 2D scrolling shooter for the NES? Why on Earth would they take the ability to make open 3D designs, and make every level a linear walk to point A,B,C... ugh, some of the worst shooter levels I've seen, although the office areas of F.E.A.R. trump it I guess. The thing is, Far Cry came out before Half Life 2, and you know what? It was wonderfully open ended. Sure you had to complete the objectives, but you weren't in a little of tube of gameplay with no other choices. Valve seemed to have gone backwards gameplay-wise, like another bigshot that crashed, id with Doom 3, they could not capitalize on the things that make gameplay great and so the game was just a hollow tribute to lots of money spent on art and self worship.

That said, I think Valve is very gradually trying to overcome the criticisms levied at them. It's not happening overnight, but I wonder, maybe we'll see a Half Life 3 that makes everyone happy and not just those who like their games dead simple.","Bug ridden engine, uncreative level design",1181520000,4,,

The game is fun for maybe 2-3 days but after that the reality begins to sink in that the game is just the same old standard mmo fare of destroy X amounts of ships, than kill Y amount of bad guys on ground or a ship corridor and/or scan Z number of items. This pattern repeats over and over with the same kind of setup in space or a really small instance on the ground. The space combat instances all look the same, the ground maps are really small instances(surrounded by invisible walls) devoid of any life except the bad guys, few small buildings and maybe plants. And to top it off every mission you do involves 4-5 load screens which really gets annoying and don't really give you the feeling of a huge persistent world. The battle-ground style pvp I found fun and is in my view well-done but thats about it and I don't think it merit me paying a monthly sub for the game.

I will like to re-emphasize that the missions are highly repititive and are all killing and more killing which might be some alternate version of star trek as even DS9 which was a heavy war-oriented trek series had its fair shair of episodes just on exploration or diplomacy or social issues. The only aspect to look forward in this mmo is getting a new shiny ship every new tier and than rinse and repeat the same kind of missions over and over with only the mobs spieces or the space-ships or the battle scenery changing for the next 10 levels till you hit the lvl cap. There is no real exploration or diplomacy or social issues interplay in the game to atleast what we saw in the star trek tv series or universe.

You pretty much die the moment you get hit. I recently put it back into my ps2 because I'd decided I never really gave it too much of a chance but it was a big mistake. It made me hate myself even more for wasting all that money and time. You'd be happier if you threw your money into an office shredder.

When I first played it as a demo a year ago I immediately purchased it because of the fun community aspects and advanced and unique interactions within the game. I met many people in the game and developed many friends, worked tirelessly to advance my character, and had a whole lot of fun. For a guy who loves Star Wars and a guy who likes computer gaming, this game was fantastic. But all that changed on the dark day of April 28, 2005, when Sony Online Entertainment butchered this game in a weak attempt to lighten it up for casual players they hoped to draw in after Episode III.

I will not get into specifics, but suffice to say this so called ""Combat Upgrade"" tore the soul out of this game. A mass exodus of easily fifty-percent of the game's total playerbase commenced within the first few weeks of this patch- some of these players being veterans of the games who had been playing for nearly two years. Glitches were abound, balance fell apart, and it became so bitterly comical that my character, a pretty experienced avatar, fell dead to the killer sting of a butterfly in game. Combine this with the fact that some people's characters are irrefutably damaged, many of my personal in-game items including my home and weapons all disappeared, and the fact that this game is now nothing more than a 15 dollar a month exercise in futility and you'll soon realize that this is one game you don't want to own.

So be smart. Don't buy Star Wars Galaxies or its derivitives. It costs money to play, and there are more bugs and glitches in this game than in the first release of it back in August of 2003.

Click to play, configuration tool crashes over and over - BAD.

/figure out a way around configuration tool by starting the game through a 2ndary launcher inbeded in the program files. /successfully launched skipping the configuration tool.

So that was frustrating.

Gameplay - BAD

First issue, Crashes caused by conversations with npcs, which occurred from the start of the game and plagued it until the end, when it first happen windows gave a solution of a Mass Effect 1 Patch - which was easy enough to download and install but DIDN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE...  Its completely RANDOM when it happens sometimes a npc will trigger it, sometimes not.  LOL it literally says ""file not found"" and crashes, restart and Presto it works VERY RANDOM but must of restarted me 12+ times.  SAVE before EACH and Every NPC you talk to - to limit annoyance.

Cover system made of fail - pulls you into cover just by walking next to something awkward, and bad angles.

Item Cap of 150 /fail *blinks* if your already allowing me to carry around 100+items why the heck is there a cap at all?  And sorting the inventory out was a pain.  Games in general need to stop adding Caps like this, FF7 was great and you could hold 99 of everything.

Actual fighting/gameplay a form of torture clunky, clunky, CLUNKY - don't bother with cover its useless.

Land Rover - giggity, whoever thought it was a good idea or even fun needs ran over by it.  Its like they never took the time to explore their own maps with it, getting stuck going up a hill and falling back down IS NOT FUN.  Which brings me to another point, whoever designed their map levels needs to lay off the obsessive amount of mountains on EVERY planet.  It was INCREDIBLY unfun having to explore with the rover, when it bounces around like a weightless rag-doll on every little bump and don't have enough power to climb a hill.

Elevators - HORRIBLE you'll spend alot of time just tapping your foot waiting on the obnoxiously long elevator rides THAT ARE USED EVERYWHERE IN THE GAME.......
its actually a ""thank god"" moment when you run into a short elevator ride in the game YEAH ITS THAT BAD... 3-5 minutes stuck in a elevator staring at the screen is unacceptable especially considering they are so FREQUENT.

Sniper rifle wobble - Shepard on some kind of drug?  is he/she not a trained soldier?  Why can't he hold it still?  Even when you get the ability to add 2 25% weapon stability upgrades it's shake is pretty bad...  I'll never understand what was going through their head on this one.  As a amateur hunter i don't have any issue with shaking my gun like I'm hopped up on sugar pops OR WORST...

Story - Wasn't bad.

i think i might of liked it better than Me2, at least the end bad guy wasn't a ridiculous ""HUMAN REAPER"" oh noes!  - why they would even mechanically choose such a shape just shows lack of creativity.  Which truth be told this series lacks in spades.

Generally Clunkyness of the game and crash frustrations ruin any immersion.

Take note my machine far surpasses its recommended system requirements by a tremendous length.

It did some things better than Me2

For example every star system you go to has ""something"" to do in it.  But that is cut asunder by the horrible land rover you get to explore the planets with.

No Ammo was a cool idea, only overheating.

Ability to Sell stuff for Credits - this is good, but ultimately useless as there is very little worth buying, and the 150 item cap drove me insane. - I ended with 9,999,999 (max) useless credits.

overall if i would of played this before Me2 i wouldn't of bought Me2 cus the genre would be dead to me.  Me2 is at least playable.  This is borderline unplayable, i managed to get through it by jamming to music in the background and reminding myself of the bigger picture Me2/Me3...",Bad,1332979200,2,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

By reading through the reviews here you can tell what one of the major problems are: it takes too long and too much effort to assemble the gun, and the games that utilize it aren't worth that effort.  Once assembled, it feels rather robust, although that little nunchuck cord holder will break for sure.  Once you have the gun, forget any notion that you'll be able to effectively use any of the buttons on the remote other than B.  Then comes the play control.  Having the remote mounted on top of the light gun gives you MUCH less accuracy than you'd have if you were using just the remote by itself.  Aiming and shooting is extremly clumsy, and the sensor bar's weakness is even more evident here.

Then comes Link's Crossbow Training.  This game is a waste of time.  It's overly difficult given the clumsiness of the gun, and it seems as though it was thrown together in a single day.  It doesn't even come in a DVD case...just a cheap paper sleeve like Wii Sports.  I played the game without the gun, and actually did much better while still being pleasantly challenged.

I returned it the very next morning. I'd put maybe fifteen minutes into it the night before, and ejected it in disgust.

This game pretends to have character customization. It'll let you shorten or lengthen your character's arms and legs, and give him muscles. That's about it. Oh, you can change hair color. There are a couple styles, but they all pretty much look alike. And that's it.

I thought maybe it would redeem itself--after all, Fable could be rather linear but it was great--but when I watched the first cutscene I groaned. It was terrible. I could tell someone spent all of five minutes on it before shoving the product on the shelves in the hope of making a few bucks before gamers caught on. The characters looked wooden and the voice acting was the worst I've heard in years. The writing was almost as bad. Imagine characters who sound like they're reading words off a medical chart while going out of their way to sound medieval.

Example:

""Hail, my lord! Art thou the bounty hunter that wast summoned by mine village elder?""
""Aye, that be I. Where be thy village elder that I mighte speakethe with himeth?""

And so on and so forth. It's friggin' painful. And the subject matter is so incredibly generic I can't...actually, that about does it: incredibly generic.

In the first dungeon--which I think is supposed to be a tutorial--I encountered two enemies. The first in the game! Ask any gamer--the first enem(ies) a game throws at you are always set up to be impossible to lose to. The game just wants you to get your feet wet, test the controls.

Not here. I died seven times trying to kill the first enemies in the game. Two hits from them was enough to kill me. It was like the game accidentally dropped me in the final dungeon instead of the first.

Finally I managed to kill them. I don't know how, because the controls are so loose it's nigh impossible to keep your crosshairs on the target. Pure luck, and lots of respawning nearby. Oh, I forgot to mention that--that's six or seven deaths with my cumulative damage still on those two baddies. If this was a foreshadow of the kind of ridiculous imbalance I'd see later on, it was a bad, bad sign.

My next challenge was opening a locked gate. I found my lockpicks on the menu (the horrible, horrible menu) but couldn't figure out how to use them on the gate.

The menu graphics look like they were imported directly from a Sega Genesis. It's half impossible to tell what things are in your inventory, and all of the menu commands are counterintuitive--except looting. I figured out how to use potions. That was a major victory.

This game pretends to be like Oblivion--hence that schmuck's comparison I mentioned--in that there's an overworld with several locations you can find and explore. Also, you can buy a horse. And that about does it for those similarities--but I had to mention them, because the game throws them in your face.

I'm very glad I only rented this and didn't purchase it. If I had, I would've demanded my money back.

The graphics are on par with the early days of the PS2 and not what I have come to expect.  From the 3 levels that I could stomach I found the controls choppy,  the interaction between Eragon and Brom non exsistent and ultimatly found Brom to be quite a useless partner when taking out any enemy.  9/10 his bow shots miss and he rarely ever quickly finishes anyone off leaving you to do most of the work.  From what I read in the book it was Brom who constantly saved Eragon not the other way around.  Methods of healing are few and far between.  most times you find yourself going through check point after check point toughing it out with what little health you start with.  the cut scenes between each level do nothing to really help the story but as an excuse to not reveal too much information about the story itself.  Quite early in the story Sapphira helps out in a big way and her part in this story I have yet to see other than the reason that the entire story picked up.  Had I not read the book I can easely see myself not really caring about any of the characters and generally wondering, ""Why am I wasting my time with this?"" coupled with ""Thank God I rented instead of buying.""

This is why I rarely pay full price for games any more. Games like this get so many preorders that the company does not care if there are broken elements when released.

The multiplayer DOES NOT WORK. Today is 11/20/14 and the game has been out over a week! There was supposed to be a patch last night, but it has been delayed.

I bought this game mostly for the multiplayer experience. I don't mind co-op campaign, but you cannot even do that via matchmaking! You have to do it from friends on your buddy list.

I work full time and I do not have time to play games all day. I like to get home from work, eat dinner, and then play a couple hours of co-op (like Gears of War, CoD, etc), but I cannot even do that with this piece of trash.

We've finished the game numerous times, and have maxed out all the turtles with stats. With this in mind, I happened to be out shopping and saw this one on the shelves. I figured this one is probably more appropriate for my son, it's four player, and he might enjoy it. It even looks like the new cartoon.

This game is the reason why video games should be returnable.

The sound is awful. One turtle sounds clear, the next makes me cringe that my speakers will explode. There's no creativity in the moves. The graphics are clunky. It's hard to navigate around even the most open terrain. Even the boss battles are poorly done, including unnecessary stoppage of game play to show awful animations from the bosses. A game like this should be intuitive, yet the makers felt it necessary to give a tell as to when enemies can be grabbed and tossed. There are apparently ""exclusive codes"" out in the world somewhere, but there's no indication as to how to get them, or even what to do, in fact. And you know every time you earn an achievement, because the game pauses for about 2 seconds (yes, two seconds doesn't seem long, but why a pause at all? It's not necessary, and it constantly panicks you into thinking your system has frozen). There aren't even ads or reviews anywhere for this one.

I've been playing COD titles since the first MW and really haven't found the single player campaigns to be exciting...in fact, they're horrible; some of the worst single player campaigns I've ever played. For $60, I've always expected more, but I don't get that from the recent COD games. Sure, they're essentially multiplayer games, but at some point, we won't be able to use those modes once the new wave of consoles hit the market, and we're stuck with a very, very bad set of games.

The multiplayer fixes some of the bugs that ruined MW2, such as constant bombardments from the air, grenade launcher madness, and the ability to hack (although it's still early enough to where we could see some of this in the coming months). However, there are new problems: Maps that are poorly designed to the point you will experience many matches getting killed within a matter of seconds after spawning, terrible spawning points, low health/taking only 1-3 bullets to die.

While I've enjoyed the nerfing of such things as grenade launchers, and even grenades themselves to a certain extent, it still is extremely aggravating to when you do use any of these weapons, they detonate right next to the opposition, and don't die. I can't even count how many times I've died where it has only taken a couple of bullets to take me down. It's terribly frustrating. The map layout is poor where they run more in a circle with various catacombs. This makes it easier to die more often and a bit easier for people who like to camp.

The Spec Ops modes are still fun, but some of them are way too difficult even on the easiest difficulty. The new Survival mode is pretty fun, especially if you get in on it with some friends.

Otherwise, COD has run its course. I can say enough how grateful I am to have not spent any money on this bad game. The campaign is still terrible and the multiplayer has seen some improvements in areas that really hurt MW2, but come with a new batch of issues that still make the experience frustrating and the improvements pointless. I would save your money. The COD franchise isn't what it used to be. The entire franchise fell apart after the first MW; although Black Ops wasn't too bad. In any case, I would advise not to buy anymore of these games. Spend your hard-earned money on better titles.

Edit: After playing more multiplayer, I have come to the realization that hacking does occur now. The ability to play fair is impossible in these horrible games. COD has completely lost its fun mark.

1.0,False,"06 12, 2007",AKBH21PTTCWVJ,B0000ZUGZ4,D. Bass,"In fairness, ""F.E.A.R."" excels in several areas. First, the combat style is innovative and fresh, even though it wears thin after a while. The slow-motion option is a nice touch, but the programmers should have let you use it only in certain situations. As it stands in the game, it's far too easy to slip into slow-mo and eradicate enemies without much problem. The game would have been ten times more difficult if this ability had been limited. As it was, even while playing on ""hard"" level, I died only once or twice and beat the game in a relatively short period of time. Secondly, as noted by other reviewers, the sound and lightning effects are superb. The shadows are especially good and can lead to some scary moments. Third, it's nice how the programmers included a function that lets you ""test drive"" the graphics frame rate prior to actually playing the game. This lets you determine which bells and whistles slow down your system and which do not.

Unfortunately, the good aspects noted above cannot outweigh the bad. First off, the violence and language are taken to a ridiculous extreme. Thankfully, you can reduce the gore (somewhat) in the game menu, and there is a patch that removes most (though not all) of the foul language, but that's not sufficient to salvage the effort. The game would have been just as good -- even better -- without all of the needless violence and potty mouths. Other games, especially those in the adventure genre, create legitimately scary atmospheres without resorting to cheap horror movie tricks (remember, the best selling PC game of all time is a non-violent point-and-click adventure game that is truly unique). The key to creating a sense of scariness is to leave most everything to the imagination of the gamer. ""F.E.A.R."" does this well in some instances, but in others it jumps overboard and drowns.

In terms of story and level design, the initial missions are quite good, but the novelty quickly wears off into boredom. One of the good things about ""Half Life 2"" is the level variety. There is constantly something to engage your mind, not just your trigger finger. In ""F.E.A.R,"" the levels are basically the same and the pattern grows tiresome. The story is pieced together in a fragmented way. I had to search online to figure out what exactly happened in the end. The system requirements are also way off the charts. I have a fairly decent computer (2.8GHz Pentium 4, 1.5GB PC3200 RAM, GeForce 6800GT graphics), and I could not run the game on high resolution without getting significant lag. Even with the graphics turned down, I could only get an average of 35 frames per second, which is not the best. Perhaps it's due to poor programming, since ""Half Life 2"" provides equal graphics without eating your computer's hardware.

While there are some fun aspects, overall the game gets a losing score due to needlessly excessive violence and language, a terribly plotted story, and boredom-inducing levels.","One or two good points, but a loser overall",1181606400,2,,

The driving is sub par with cars overly willing to spin out and lose control rather than maintain course after even the slightest of collisions which makes moving around the game very frustrating and time consuming. So you'll find yourself calling for cabs a lot, but frequently they don't show up at all or take several minutes to show up and by then you've lost patience and took off on foot. There is far too much traffic as well slowing you down that much more and the roads are usually just a little too narrow to try and squeeze between all the cars on the road. It all just makes for a slow frustrating experience.

Unlike GTA 4 where your cheat codes can be typed in one time and then they automatically save in the character's phone for future quick access under fire, in the xbox 360 version at least, they are around 12 buttons long and have to be entered on the fly while playing. Then to make it worse, the cheat codes consist of buttons that you wouldn't want to press during shootouts or while driving. For example, you're driving down the freeway at god knows what speed and have to enter a code but the code has the Y button in it so when youenter the code the player jumps from the moving vehicle and dies!!!! How does that help exactly? Again, just slows you down and makes for a very slow and frustrating experience.

Lastly, one of the absolute most fun parts of past GTA games was the ability to utilize the cheat codes to access guns and body armour  and get into huge shootouts with the cops and here and there put the code in again to keep your heath up so extend the fun of watching the police force get bigger and bigger until they call in the actual army and you basically fighting a one man war, and winning!!! Now how ever, in combination with the cheat codes being so slow, the cop's are far more leathal and will kill you way too fast for you to have any fun. Boring!!!

Overall, I wish I hadn't bought this game. This is the weakest version of GTA since it's rebirth in GTA 3.

Update: This game is terrible. I got about halfway through and it just died. It keeps freezing up and crashing my Xbox. I looked it up online and it is a very common problem! Skip this game at all costs, it's a complete waste of money at any price!!!",Weak!!!,1487116800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The test car that was going to measure my skills sat on the side of the track in the grass with a running motor.  I then went back to the Main Menu options, chose edit for each control box, and steered the wheel, pressed the pedals, and pressed the buttons of the Thrustmaster to have the settings necessary to operate my wheel recognized.  Returning to the race screen, I was now looking forward to the test lap.  Well, the car was on the track, but it wouldn't stay there--unsafe at any speed!  I then returned to the Main Menu and chose ""adjust options.""  I saw that the steering sensitivity had been set to 25% and switched that to 100%.  Returning to the game screen, I was now able to stay on the track at about five miles an hour on a zig-zag course.

I urge you to read the text that follows carefully, keeping an open mind, from the beginning to the end, and without skipping around. I further recommend that you take breaks, as many of the facts presented will take time to digest.

We must let Bungie know, in no uncertain terms, that it has done inestimable damage to everything around it. Those who claim otherwise do so only to justify their own contemptible conclusions. If we are powerless to make some changes here, it is because we have allowed Bungie to keep a close eye on those who look like they might think an unapproved thought. My vision that some day, people everywhere will say ""no"" to Bungie's irritating roorbacks is an inspiring dream. Unfortunately, reality always awakens me and reminds me that I've heard Bungie say that you and I are inferior to mindless lumpenproletariats. Was that just a slip of the lip or is Bungie secretly trying to render unspeakable and unthinkable whole categories of beliefs about power? The complete answer to that question is a long, sad story. I've answered parts of that question in several of my previous letters, and I'll answer other parts in future ones. For now, I'll just say that it has been said that those who think that it has the trappings of deity should think again. I, in turn, claim that it is doing everything in its power to make me abandon all hope. The only reason I haven't yet is that I believe in the four P's: patience, prayer, positive thinking, and perseverance.

Speaking as someone who has been a rabid fan of the series since the very first one on the NES, Ill say two things: Jim is exactly right, and playing this game broke my heart.

The one and only positive I can give FF13 is that it has gorgeous visuals. Thats what the 2-score in my review is for. It fails in every other category so badly that it feels like some other company trying to make a knock-off FF game (think Sonys Legend of Dragoon for PS1) rather than an officially sactioned entry into the series. It doesnt deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as classics like IV, VI, VII, or X. Its unbelievable that Squeenix is granting an unprecedented two sequels to this game while utterly ignoring, for years on end, pleas from their fans to do a modern-day remake of 7, 6 or even 5.

Why is it so bad? Let me count the ways. First of all, the story is weird & stupid. I stopped caring about it early on and didn't like any of the characters. Secondly, there is practically no exploration. Almost the entire game is a brutally linear affair, and I mean that quite literally as areas tend to shuffle you through a completely straight path. No exploring towns, no buying weapons from the weapon shop, no hidden dungeon areas with secret chests, etc. Things finally open up at one point, but not for 30 or 40 hours or so and even then, its a relatively small environment that is boring to travel through. The music, usually a dependable staple of the series, is terrible as well. I mean, they put words in the chocobo song. Good grief, why? There isn't a single memorable track.

Gameplay is terrible, as well. Theres not a whole lot of thinking involved and it almost plays itself. The summoning system is truly bizarre (I did a facepalm when I saw the Shiva motorcycle; seriously, WTF is that about?) and the worst the series has ever seen. I played this game for a good, long while, about 75% through, before giving up on it in disgust. To give you some idea of how bad this game is, I didn't care much at all for the story of FF12, either, but I still had fun with it. FF13 never gave me a moment of enjoyment.

First of all without a hard drive you won't be able to use the xbox live store, cause you can't download anything from it.  So that could be a consideration for you if you want to play any online only games.  Also there are the dual pitfalls of the red rings and other problems.  Like mine.  I have had mine for only 1year, and it's never ever had any problems at all, until suddenly today.  No red rings, nothing like that, just freezing.  Can't play a game longer than 1min till it freezes.  I called and microsoft said that it wasn't a red ring issue so they won't pay for it, so if I want to fix it it will be at least $100 minimum.  Personally I  don't think it's worth it.  So think carefully. I took every precaution with mine and it still blew up.  There is I would say a 100% chance that this console will blow up on you in 2 years or less, resulting in a large repair cost.  Keep that in mind before you buy.

I really wanted to like/love FF14, i even bought a 2000$ gaming pc just for this game, i ended up wasting 2000$ :(
I'll try to find good pc games at least i guess since I'm mostly a console gamer, anyway

SE released incomplete game and they know it, there are so many bugs and i expect them to be fixed sooner or later (you can't sell junk to npc lot of times, get reallly annoying when your bag is full, Cure RAISE you from death, cant see party members hp/mp, etc so many bugs)

In this game you will be fighting the user interface mostly not the enemies ! everything is slow and horrible, you will die a lot because of the horrible UI not the enemies and I'm not kidding sadly, so many times it get locked and you can't cure yourself, sometimes the monster attack you and you can not attack him saying ""your target is engaged by you"" yet i can not draw my weapon or attack it.

There is no content whatsoever and the 3 main starter cities combined are smaller than sandoria alone (Sandoria is 1 of the main cities in ff11)

Believe it or not there are ZERO quest in the game, no npc give any quest (no story quests/reward quests to get armor or weapon etc)

The only thing available in the game right now is the guild leve missions and you can only use few every 2 days, there are not a lot of variety in environments, there are 3 cities and 3 BIG field areas mainly (which look really boring after a while, SE decided to use 3 big fields that look exactly the same from start to finish instead of using various fields connected to each other with different music, the bit 3 fields are really huge, as big as a region in ff11 but it look the same in every corner with the same 2min soundtrack getting repeated again and again,

Right now the only ones who are enjoying the game are the ones who enjoy ""leveling up"" so they wear the higher level gear and that's it.

If you want to buy it for storyline don't bother, there are 3 story missions per city and that's it (you can't even watch the story of the other cities because there is no way to switch your main city unlike FF11) pretty much 30min of story content and they will update it over the years i guess just like with FF11.

I really wanted to love the game but atm it's ""leveling only"" i feel like it's a job instead of a ""game""

Leveling take MUCH more time than FF11 that's for sure don't let the general thoughts of leveling in FF14 trick you ! can you solo EXP? YES you can but is leveling faster or on par with FF11? HELL NO, leveling your class is based on skill not exp so you can kill 10 monsters and still won't advance anything at all, it's luck based, sometimes you kill 10 monsters and get 0 skill, and sometimes you kill 3 monsters and get 200 skill points for your weapon, your level depends on your weapon ""skill"" so you can say FF14 leveling system is like ""skill up parties"" in FF11 but worse !

Also crafting is a big part of the game unlike FF11, you have to craft in ff11 or know a friend who can help you with crafting, because armors/weapons/etc BREAK in this game and get damaged SOOOOO FAST, and only crafters can repair them (you can use the repair npc to fix your stuff but he charge WAAAY too much even in early levels, basically you can buy the armor NEW from crafter for the same price as repairing it from an npc)

Also when your weapon get damaged in the field you will have to run back to the city to find a crafter to fix it (which take a lot of time if you don't know a crafter) people even carry multiple weapons/armors now to avoid going back to the city to fix this weapons

As you see too many bad things to say about this game and so little good to say, the only good thing is the graphic in my opinion.

There is no AH house in the game and SE have no plans to add one, they only plan to enhance the bazaar system.
you have to go through so many characters to check what you want to buy (require so many buttons through a laggy UI, you can't just /browse a character. most people don't even check the bazar area anymore because you can basically spend 5 hours checking bazaars and ended up not finding what you were looking for to begin with.

I have decided not to pay for the game once my free first month is over, i will keep looking at the game and will properly return when they actually add content OR anything to do in the game, atm it's a grind fest which does not interest me at all, to me grinding in ff11 was the worst parts but it was worth it because you end up doing a lot of great content that actually require those higher level jobs unlike ff14.

Hopefully SE will fix this game sooner, if you read other reviews here you will see so many issues that i didn't even mention yet every ff14 player suffer from.

I don't know what SE were thinking when they released the game at current state, i will keep the game in my radar for its upcoming updates/expansion but right now the game is not playable for me and whenever they decide to fix it i will definitely play it again because it does have potential.",FF XIV Review from FF11 player,1286150400,15,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

1)graphics are awful, more then a snes game, this looks as a nes game.
2)easy version for the us audience, is too damn easy
3)no dush button, the game is terrible slow
4)very bad and censored script
5) Where's the ATB gauge? without gauge, the ATB is pointless
6) conversion is terrible! Cut everything! Cut magics, cut skills, censored text, cut out difficulty, this is tolerable?

1) music is annoying, 20 seconds MIDI endlessly repeated
2)short game, less then 20 hours
3)The plot has absolutely zero depth or detail
4)primitive gameplay, no job system, no esper system, no materia system, nothing of nothing
5)don' t even choose party members, the story choose your party ( most strategic game ever eh?)
6)the game world is too generic, no information at all. The game has 8 countries, but, you do not know anything about them.
7) no description of items
8) in the equipment shops, you don't see the changes of statistics
9)too large party so little time, characters don't receive a true development besides kain or cecil

Unfortunately, although it is listed as ""1-4 players"", that isn't quite true.  Only the single-player ""Story Mode"" gives you access to the entire thirty games available.  The Co-op stage only lets you play five games, about two of which are worth playing more than once.  There is a simple shooting gallery (nothing moving though), a frog-fishing game, whack-a-mole, an incredibly dull game where you move a hoop along a cord and one more that was so boring I can't even remember it.

As the single-player, you can spend time unlocking the rest of the games, which are mainly variations on the original five games. For instance ""Whack-a-Ghost"" instead of ""Whack-a-Mole,"" but odds are you aren't going to want to waste the time.

Let's just keep in mind that this game is just... gear grinding.

Anyway, to the review.
Well, it's Smash. That's it. Basically just a slight upgrade from Brawl with some little differences here and there.
I really like that you can create a custom character from your Mii, give it different moves too. That's cool, I guess. Rather gimmicky though.
I also like the stage builder, probably my most favorite feature of this. I could spend hours doing that.
The Board game I think is just lame.
8-Player smash I think is just a mess.

So other than those gripes, here is what really grinds my gears.
Actually playing the game. All I can say is that all of the animation lags, the online lags, the input lags, just so much friggin' lag that really shouldn't even be there.
Trust me, I get it. It could be the wrong kind of TV (right). It could just be me (probably). It could be my network (probably). It could be that no one notices/cares.
I notice the lag offline, online, and even against the A.I.
But the gameplay overall is too sluggish due to this balance idea. Every character has some silly laggy action, which was the same problem with Brawl and I can't stand it. I haven't noticed this issue in melee or 64. Most of the characters are insanely fast, except for Ganondorf of course.
At first I really did love this one, up until I noticed all the silly lag that really shouldn't be there. It is just severely aggravating, to the point that it is unplayable.
I also miss the games that didn't need to be updated/patched/DLCed.
In all honesty, I'm just getting too old and impatient with these kinds of games. So if you are anything like me, take my advice and move on.

Oh well, just another game to add to the dust collection.

The game play is repetitve, all the fighters are the exact same sprite with palette swaps (really, they had to be THAT lazy?), and the game is overly difficult.  Not that you'll play it long enough to get very far, though.

The game play consists if you circling your opponent and mashing A and hoping for the best.  The A button is punch and the B button is block, but due to the simple animation you can never tell when your opponent will hit you, effectively rendering blocking to be useless.

The sound and music is horrible, especially the ""speech"" of the ref, which more accurately sounds like dog barking, when he counts, etc.

During the in-between round segments, there are some highly suggestive animations regarding the fighter and his corner men. When I was younger and played this game I always pressed A and B a lot during the rounds as the animation went faster, and I thought that was restoring the fighter.  I remember when I was little thinking that the animation was weird and wondered what the hell they were doing; now that I am an adult, I find it rather disturbing and quite funny that the game designers slipped that in and actually got it past Nintendo.  I would love to know the thought process on what made the game designers put that in the game.  Look up an online video and you'll see what I mean.

Same old same old, campers camp at a corner and get 30 kills and their team loses because they had no team work,.... I get 3 kills then someone re-spawns behind me and kills me. Ghosts is the only COD that really made me start camping and not doing my objective as much as I used to.
killstreaks: as title says USELESS. Maps are very big and getting heli and other killstreaks like it won't get you that many kills. On the other hand, it is good thing since nobody really cares about getting them; therefore, nobody should camp, RIGHT? WRONG... In every map, there are tons of corners and camping spots for players to camp & snipe. I just don't understand what is the point of camping when killstreaks are useless!!!
Lag is still there: when number of players go above 50000 players, I feel the lag gets worse. When I got the game, everything was fine, pretty much no lag at all. but now,.... it's crazy. Same thing that used to happen in BO II. You shoot the guy nothing happens, he shoots you, die in 3 bullets. Some people see you earlier than you see them. However, I believe it's Sony's server, not the game servers. Because I also experience lag in Killzone and BF4 ( but not as much as COD ).

BIGGEST ISSUE: for some reason IW decided to shove Clans up our asses. I never took gaming that serious to join clans. I just enjoy the game for what it is, and play it for 2-3 hours every day. However, be prepared to be put against crazy good clans because there are certain days of every month that are dedicated to clan wars. What about people who want to play alone? I'm not saying this because I'm not part of a clan ( I have a clan IMOR ), but I'm saying it because I see we go against people who just purchased the game and have no idea what is going on. It will ruin the experience for them, and it is never fun to go against 5 clan members with 3-4 times the skill of a new player. Therefore, be prepared to avoid the game in certain days of every month because you will be against clans of people who prestiged 5-6 times. In the first week of release, I could hardly see 3 people in one clan, but now pretty much 80% of every lobby is part of a clan. Don't get me wrong, clan wars are fun and challenging, but why they are mixed with regular players?? just have them play in a separate lobby.

Over all: this is the list that I recommend for you guys out there, if you just want to buy one FPS multiplayer PS4 game. Here is my list:
1- Battlefield 4( Interesting campaign, crazy good MP )
2- Killzone ( OK campaign, very fun MP)
3- COD ghosts",The game is GARBAGE now,1388793600,11,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Unless, of course, I am playing the newest version.  OK, so I'm a few hours in, got a good city (or two) going...switching back and forth, sending money or other necessities to whichever city needs it...sweet!  But all of the sudden I try to switch cities and can't.  Server is down or bad connection or whatever...nothing for however long it was down is saved.  There is no warning as you're playing (come on!...server down, connection lost, anything?).  It's just gone.  If you have to be online all the time to play, so be it, I can live with that.  But if I'm online all the time, how come when I quit I have to wait a good long time for my city to ""sync"" with the server?  Shouldn't it be synced at all times, since I'm online?  Also, it's the little things that bug you...why do fire, ambulance, police get stuck in traffic when there is a clear route around?  And they sit at stoplights...really?

What really gets my goat is that EA knew this was a borked game when they put it on the market.  They said ""whoops, sorry, here's a different free game to download"".  Then there was a bunch of double talk about not having enough servers and the game can't be made to work offline etc.  Right.  Hey EA, if you want to sell me add-ons and upgrades, great!  Done it before, happy to pay for the good stuff but don't force it down my throat!

Now I have to say, as a caveat, if you look at my stats I've played this game a lot.  Hours and hours.  But you'll also see where I've started city after city and quit and reloaded and restarted.  Mostly because after a bit of playing, the sound has quit, or clicking the menu bar brings up nothing or challenges state ""You need ?? and ?? to get 'whatever' (?? being blank spaces or filled with gobbledygook)"" or things simply get out of whack and I quit, only to find there is no contact with the server.

The game is very fun, while it's working.  Unfortunately, for a hardcore gamer like myself, it doesn't seem to ""keep"" working.  Unfortunately for me, I'll keep trying, keep reloading and restarting and hoping things get fixed.  As for the free game download, Thanks EA!  But fix the dang game I purchased!

Edited:  Another game.  Tried to switch cities, got the ""Please try again"" message. Tried to quit and save, ""Please try again"".

* Game mechanics, skill sets, gear enhancement opportunities and build options have all the depth of a damp washcloth. Group mechanics? Nope! Class specific roles? Nada! Class specializations? Nuh-uh! There's only three things you need to remember to be ""good"" in GW2 and those three things are D, P, and S. That's it.

* The AI cheats like no game you have ever seen before.

* PvE so-called commanders try to dictate the activity that takes place on certain PvE maps and there's no shortage of people perfectly willing to be led around by the nose by these people. Fortunately, this sort of thing has dropped off a lot lately. Unfortunately, Arenanet had to remove every champ-level mob from every starter map to stop the stupid level 80s from farming them in a giant loop, demanding that no one else try to take them on until the farming grouped, dubbed the noob train, got there. This resulted in a massive amount of toxicity in chat and a general hatred of one group of players toward another. Not surprisingly, these noob trains were always being led by one of the aforementioned so-called PvE commanders, at least one  of which was actually reporting players for not doing what he (a random nobody) said.

Regardless how how shallow and boring the game is, this ""commander"" stupidity is my biggest beef with this game. It's a pretended authority that anyone can have by simply BUYING the commander status. There's no requirement to being one other than having enough gold to buy the stupid thing and it means absolutely nothing. It isn't like Aion where you have different player ranks that are EARNED and have to be maintained based on your PvP activity and level of involvement in certain major aspects of the game. Nope, it's a status that's based purely on your purchase of it.

Now they even have a free similar status called Mentor that people try to use exactly like the commander status. Everybody gets this for free with the expansion and I like to call the people that use this one ""welfare commanders"".

At any rate, this is a pretty junk game. If you try it, just pick whatever class you like best. It doesn't really matter because the only substantial difference in them is the names of their skills and their animations. Other than that, all the classes and all their skills are essentially identical to each other. Any significant difference is just a facade and the entire game boils down to a max DPS zerg-farming affair. Even the abysmal dungeon instances are simply nothing more than DPSing down waves of stupidly OP mobs that cheat like crazy, one by one, until they're all dead.

However, even if I do not review it as a successor of one of my favorite RPGs -- Dragon Age Origins, it still has too many problems of its own. The companions are mostly stereotype characters without any development. Many people mentioned the reused dungeons but that was not the only problem. Those were cloned to the point that you may visit a ""new dungeon"" for another side quest and found it not only look identical to the one you just cleared. But you have to fight the same monsters and pick up random treasures at exactly the same locations.  Keep in mind that you have to revisit those dungeons over and over again in all 3 acts. Another issue is the item system.  It is worse than a 1996 action RPG called Diablo. In Diablo, random items are named based on its attributes. So for example if you see a ""King's Sword of Haste"", you know it does extra damages and comes with fastest speed. In Dragon Age 2, you may get many random items  under many different names with exactly the same useless attributes. This makes inventory management very tedious as it's hard to compare items and decide which ones to keep.  Also you get a lot of useless junks under many different names. So a lot of time would be spent picking up and selling all those useless items, some of which could actually have had some use to your companions but the game doesn't allow them to use most of them.  The side quests themselves are also very repetitive. Many of them are like go somewhere to kill a certain group of people, and you quickly find another identical one to kill a different group. Parts of the main quests also felt like partially copied from DA:O and just replace with a different character. It is very lack of originality. Playing this game feels like doing chores.  Sometimes I wanted to give up but continued in order to see the final ending. To my surprise, the ending was actually somewhat interesting. But I really have no interest of doing the same chores again. I guess the game probably started with an ambitious goal to improve on top of DA:O but instead cut many corners due to budget and release deadlines. It is very dissappointing that the story and characters are so boring that all the improvements(full voice, in some cases improved graphics) have been completely offset.

Gears of war trashed resistance fall of man. Back then, the graphics, gameplay, physics, and even the AI, story, and characters, were all strikingly new and fresh. Of course, you can't praise gears' story and characters without getting mocked, but I remember being interested in the main character, imprisoned for desertion/treason by the coalition of organized governments, who is then freed out of desperation as humanity runs out of soldiers.

The city you explore is one that fell during Marcus' incarceration.  The court that convicted him has been abandoned to the locust, and the people who convicted him are either dead or evacuated.  Awesome.

What's special about it, is that he never turns his back on humanity. ""i'm not doing this for you"".

I still love hearing Marcus Fenix voice.  It's got that movie magic to it, and it's an strong now as it was then.  The haunting song ""14 years after E day"" still perfectly helps set the dark tone of the game.  The sound design is still king.

Everything about it felt next gen, aside from the laggy, host advantage peer to peer online gameplay. One shotgun roller was in a class of his own, and you just had to hope it was you, or at least that he was on your team.

Much of it has aged.  Most of it poorly.  You basically move from cover to cover, shooting enemies, for hours on end with very little else happening to break up the monotony.

The time and effort they put into reskinning this game could have been invested in a brand new game entirely, a new story, new characters, Hell, maybe even a brand new franchise.

It feels like the only reason this game exists is to make money. Fans of the franchise, like me, already played gears of war multiple times back when it was new.

I just fail to grasp the concept here. What were they thinking?

It's ironic because the problems with gears of war were obviously never it's graphics. So they tried to fix the graphics. wtf?

Why remake a decade old game without changing anything but the graphics? Who was like 'gears of war will sell copies once we fix the graphics'  lol...  who greenlit this project?

It's painful how repetitive the game feels today. The whole production feels small now. It lacks the spectacle and scope of gears 2, the jaw dropping set pieces... I remember how satisfied I was to roll, roadie run, slide into and mantle over cover, stop and pop, back when I'd never done it before. But now we've all been doing this for 4 games. 4 Gears of War games, and now they try to get people to pay 40$ to replay the original? How many cover shooters have we played since then? Over and over and over and over, and now go back to the very first that got it right. And they want 40 dollars to do that?  And Microsoft wonders why they're losing this generation.  The asking price is an insult to fans of the franchise.  Gears 3 cost less at launch.

Videogames, and even the gears of war franchise, have come a long way in the last 10 years. This remake hasn't.

Gears, Grand Theft Auto, and  Uncharted, three of the highest reviewed franchises in existence, have been cranking out cover shooters for 9 years, and things have changed.

Is Microsoft even going to try to beat Sony?  This isn't the way.  I also fail to see how this fits into Microsoft's arsenal of exclusive games.  What PS4 owner is going to say to themselves ""Gears of War one for 40 bucks?  I'm buying and Xbox One!""  Nobody is going to say that.  When you look back at the megahits that shaped the Xbox brand, they were halo, Halo 2, and Gears of War.  Where does Gears of War Ultimate at this price point fit into the picture.  No where.  It's a huge misstep that fans of the franchise are never going to forget, and PS4 gamers aren't going to care about.  You're either being insulted, or you just don't care.

What we should have gotten, was a compilation of gears 1, 2, and 3 in 1080p and 60fps for 10$ or so.

Also, the reskin doesn't look that much different than the original. If your'e going to reskin an entire game, shouldn't you be aiming for a completely different look? I mean, if you're trying to maintain the look, feel, and tone of the original, why the hell reskin it? Gears Ultimate wouldn't even look like the original if I had my way. You wouldn't even be able to recognize it. But not so, you always know exactly where you are, because you can always recognize the geometry and the colors and textures that look very similar. I never ever felt lost in a new game world. It's a testament to how iconic the original is/was, and yet another reason this game should never have been made.

I'm not even sure if the remaster looks better than the original.  I know it doesn't look as good as Gears 4.

Everytime I play Gears Ultimate, I wish I was playing Gears 4 instead.

I should be able to easily see the graphical improvements given it's on a next gen console, but the only thing I'm sure of is that it's running at a higher resolution.  Big deal.  Higher res graphics do not always translate into better graphics.

Gears of War's graphics were a masterpiece then, and in my eyes they still are.  It's a classic.  No need for a reskin.  It's the rest of the game that's the problem.

Ultimate's graphics style is like  ""imagine if we made gears of war look more like every other game on the market"".  It just feels bland and uninspired, like no one had a clear vision of what the game should be, and that's something gears of war never lacked, vision.  I think that's why this remake is such a failure.  It lacks the vision and sense of purpose of the original.

I do not personally feel that the new textures look better all the time.  They usually have higher resolution, yes, but there are many times when I wonder if the original's graphics are superior.

It does not look worse than the original, but I feel that most times it just looks a little different.  The plastic sheen on characters faces is lessened, and I agree that this might be somewhat of an improvement. I honestly feel like there should be no contest between this next gen remake and the original.  Gears Ultimate should be flat out wasting Gears one, and it doesn't.  It should be blatantly obvious which game looks better.  I don't really blame the artists for this.  There wasn't much room for improvement to begin with.

Another irony. Microsoft needed gears of war last generation, needed a way to beat Sony. Yet again, Microsoft needs another gears of war, another way to beat sony. And here it is. haha. It's just like microsoft to crank out a game like this, especially for this price.

They've finally stopped reselling us windows over and over, and started reselling us gears.

What if instead of making this, they had made a prequel to Gears of War, where you start as Fenix fighting in the pendulum wars, then Emergence Day happens, and you attempt to repel the locust invasion.  Fight at asypho fields and see what happened there.  That would have been awesome.

Or what if they retold Gears of War one in an alternate reality?  What if they decided to break Fenix out of prison against the cog's wishes?  What if you fought through the city as it was falling, rather than after it had fallen?

Or what if everything had been redesigned, so it's the same exact story, but the shape and look of everything is different.  The prison and everthing else is designed differently, and all the boss fights redone with a different strategy to beat each?  So the plot is exactly the same but everything else is new?

So many possibilities.  So many wasted opportunities.

Gears of War 1 is simply a poor candidate for this kind of remaster. It was more about doing things 'new' than doing things well. More about revolution than evolution. It's a game that demanded sequels, demanded a franchise, demanded the creation of a new genre, and that genre has been in constant flux, constant evolution since then. Virtually almost everything about the original no longer holds up,  and now visually, it looks more like every other videogame than gears of war.  I shake my head at all this. Have the games graphics aged? Yes, a bit, and it's noticeable, but as I said before, so has everything else in the game, and they didn't see the need to fix any of that.

Gears of war wasn't just a next gen game. it was a next gen franchise. An IP born at the start of the next generation. It took advantage of all the capabilities of the xbox 360. The entire game streamed right off the disc. There were no loading times unless you died. Each soldier in your squad had their own uniquely designed and textured in high definition armor. Weapons like the sub machine gun assault rifle chainsaw combo lancer, the hammer of dawn firing burning lasers from the sky, all the different locust enemies you'd never seen before, the 'destroyed beauty' art style. Getting downed from taking damage and hoping a teamate would revive you before you got curb stomped. It was a rush of new, burning passion. And that deserves another new game, with the same drive to take us new places and show us new things. Not a reskin.

I am glad that they have finally fixed the multiplayer with dedicated servers, but its 10 years too late.  I remember how disappointed I was trying to play the original online.  Emptying entire clips into enemies and not killing them, instantly dying from a shotgun running host.  It was miserable.  The online was really the only thing about the game that didn't work.  I remember how stoked I was to get into multplayer, and damn, was it a massive let down.  Gear one was basically unplayable.

You know, thinking back to Gears one reminds me of the achievement ""always remember your first"" that you earn after your first chainsaw kill. ""always remember your first"".... can any gamer forget the first time they played gears of war? What a rush. What I want, is the next gears of war. The next shocking new experience that I'll never forget.

*update -  I've now completely finished the campaign, and I have very little to add except that I was exhausted and grateful when the train ride was over.  Memorable moments like blowing up chaps gas station are ruined by some of the fakest looking explosions I have ever seen.  I also noticed that many character models look worse than they did in the original.  I played most of the game coop as the host, and it was, at least on my end, a lag free experience.  AI Dom kept getting cornered and killed by the bezerker over and over again.

I still feel that the game makes a mistake by not letting you rescue civilians.  there's a sense that there's nothing left to fight for or protect because the game is lacking in interesting and likeable characters aside from dom and the main protagonist, but it's realistic that there's nobody left to defend in a city that fell to the locust long ago.

The added brumak fight is anticlimactic and boring, just like I remember it from the pc version.  The brumak is supposed to be scary, but the dialogue and actions of your squad diminish that fear completely.

On the multiplayer side of things, the lack of lag online has made super weapons incredibly dangerous, and all of them are easy to use.  I don't like weilding them.  It feels like cheating.  Epic should have rebalanced these weapons but they didn't.  I do not like exploiting the flaws in the system, it feels like i'm taking advantage of other people.  But you can't just let the enemy capture them, or else you're sure to lose every match.  Simply put, the grenade, boomshot and torque bow are game breaking flaws, and to a lesser extent, so is the longshot.

Of course, you have the option of 2v2 gnasher shotgun matches, but I don't want to play 4 player games.  I have no idea why there isn't a 4v4 gnasher mode.  perplexing and irritating.

Grenades make a small explosion compared to their max effective range.  Most of the time I never even see the blast, my body just disappears into a few chunks of meat for no reason.  Grenade area of effect is absolutely insane and needs to be reduced immediately.

The biggest problem with multiplayer is that you can't see the crosshairs of your shotgun without aiming down your sites.  It's a problem, because identifying exactly where the center of the screen is at while moving, watching your teamates moving, and watching your enemies moving all at the same time, is very difficult.

This is a problem that existed 10 years ago, and it still exists today.  Players are forced to tape crosshairs onto their televisions so they can blind fire the shotgun and hit their targets.  It's the only way to compete, but I refuse to do it because I know that there are other players like me who are against cheating.

The result is a game that is unplayable.

You can't aim with your shotgun without slowing down, which makes you an easy target.  You also can't instantly aim and have crosshairs appear, it takes precious milliseconds.  The best way to die against a player who has taped crosshairs onto their screen is to attempt to aim at them.  You become a large, motionless target.

Of course, epic could easily patch the problem and give everyone with the shotgun blind fire crosshairs, but out of what I imagine to be sheer laziness, they haven't.

Epic :  I am not going to tape crosshairs to my TV.  Fix your game.",A massive waste of time,1440720000,6,,

PC gamers put CoD on the map and they turn around and spit in our faces. I'm embarrassed that I spent my hard earned dollars on this turd and am really kicking myself for not checking the reviews here first.
The Pros:
Amazing Graphics, really polished visuals with varied and beautiful locales.
Gritty, adult oriented story and missions.
Very intense single player battles
The Cons:
I bought this at 8pm last night and I just beat it. It's 10am now and yes, I got a full night's sleep between then and now.
Multiplayer is some kiddy console matchmaker system that doesn't make use of servers.
9v9 max for multiplayer. No epic battles here.
No servers means no huge battles, no custom maps, no mods, to sum it up: NO RE-PLAYABILITY.
Steam. I'm not in the ""Steam=SecuROM"" camp but I still think it sucks. I've found it to be buggy and unreliable and I resent being forced to use it to play a supposed A-list game.
The single player campaign is fun despite being so short. I'll probably play through it once more today, maybe spend a day or two on the wimpy and dull multiplayer, then put this game on the shelf and dream of what else I could have spent my money on. Tomorrow or the next day, after I uninstall it (along with that stupid Steam program) I'll play a World at War custom map on a server with 31 other frag happy gamers.
Conclusion:
Wait until this hits the bargain bin. This game is more of an expansion than a full release.

1.  I am a HUGE Borderlands fan.  Loved 1 and 2.
2. Unlike some other reviewers, I also really like this one. (yes, I know this is contradictory, but stay with me).
3. I have a PS4 and hadn't purchased any new PS3 games since I purchased the PS4 (right when it came out).  Until this game came out.
4. I was completely perplexed when I saw the announcement that this title was going to come out ONLY on PS3 and XBOX360 (look it up, all the articles are still there).  I would say I was probably on the brink of being pi**ed.  I vowed to not purchase it, just for that reason.
5. I purchased it anyway and played it for a while despite the fact that I usually only use my PS4.  I finally gave up on it because it was too much of a hassle to fire up my PS3.
Up to this point, no issues.  I decided on my own to buy the game even though I was mad that they were not putting it on the PS4.
6.  THEY ARE PUTTING OUT A PS4 VERSION NOW.
If they want to change their minds, fine, but they have to recognize the fact that less than 6 months ago, I purchased this game for the PS3 after being told it would not come out on the PS4.  Honest mistake?  I think not.  They knew they would only sell PS4 versions to people who already had a PS4, but ""how can we sell the PS3 version AND the PS4 version to the same person, even if they already have a PS4????""  Like this!
So how can they fix this?  Give us a credit.  Not ""just trade it in"".  Right now this game for the PS3 will get me all of $7 and some odd cents for a trade in.  Let us return our fully working copies of the PS3 version to the manufacturer and get a credit (I would say at least $20 would be fair, but it should be more).
UPDATE:  I just posted this review a few minutes ago and then went back to the product page only to find out that I can now get $16.91 for a trade-in.  I have no idea why it went from under $8 yesterday to almost $17, but I am going to trade it in now.  BUT that still doesn't excuse the developers since this is Amazon that is giving me the trade in credit.

The only good thing is that the saved games I have from TPS on the PS3 will port to the PS4, but that does not make up for the fact that I would have waited for the PS4 version if I knew it was going to come out.
By the way, don't bother saying that this is not a true PS4 port.  I don't know if it is or not and it DOES NOT MATTER.  The point is, regardless whether or not the game is just a PS3 quality game on the PS4, it's all about the ability to play the game on my PS4 where I do all my other gaming.  I would DEFINITELY have waited the 6 months for the convenience of playing it on my PS4 if I knew it was going to come out.

UPDATE:  I just got my copy of The Handsome Collection for the PS4, and I found out that in order to transfer my saved games from the PS3, I needed to update my PS3 version (WHICH I NO LONGER HAVE) to the latest version in order to export the games so I can load them on to my PS4.
THANKS!  And just in case you think I pulled the trigger too early on trading the game in, it is now $12.61 to trade in vs. the $16.91 that I did get.  So I would have lost another $4+ if I had waited.  $4 isn't much, but when I consider losing the original $60 I paid for the PS3 version in the first place. it's just all too sad.",Loyal fan eats a $60 chunk of deceit.,1424304000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I figured a 007 game with RPG leveling system mechanics should make a great game. I was wrong in the end though. First off I won't go into a full on review because there are a few others that have already done that, I will give you a short reason why I didn't like the game. For positive reviews or pros instead of cons read another review. The main problems i had with the game is that for a stealth game it doesn't take much at all for the enemy to know your exact location. I have had too many times to count where I would be crouched by a crate and aiming in for a headshot and someone across level will see me somehow. Not only that but once they have seen you they always know where you are after that so it becomes a run and gun sort of situation. The AI for the game is also terrible. There are times where to clear a room i use a classic RPG tactic that shouldn't work in this type of game but it does. You know when you are playing your typical RPG game and you see an enemy but to engage in combat you have to touch them and the only way to get a suprise attack is to sneak up on them. Well in those types of games you try to sneak up and if the enemy notices you can walk out of their territory/vision radious and they will go back to their position. Then you sneak up on them and get a surprise attack. Well this same tactic works on this game although there isn't any strategy because you don't have to touch the enemies back to hit them. Walk in the room and let the enemy see you then run out of their radious and they turn around to go back. You simply step out and get your critical hit in the head and they die. There were some times where i would run out of the enemies radious and they would run to a certain point and then just stand there looking at me 5 feet away lol. Then there are some levels where you can sneak all the way through it just to have a heads up firefight with a boss. Let me repeat that. Sneak all the way through for it to be a heads up firefight with the boss. Whats the point? If thats the case why not run and gun on certain levels if it ends the same way. There is no point in reading up on the profiles of enemies because it doesn't increase your chances of winning anymore. There isn't much to the game other than playing through it. All the side items don't matter with all the flaws in the game you could win with the primary pistol doing the tactic stated above. Too many flaws for me and simple tactics exploit the AI and glitches in this game. Its not completely terrible but there are far to many good games out there to play mediocre ones like this. To me there isn't an excuse for the problems i faced while playing it. I think the concept was cool but for the most part the project was rushed. If you liked it good for you but to me its not worth any price because the waste of time playing it when there are other games to play.",Was a good thought but in reality epic fail,1292803200,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

Here is the deal, yeah the graphics are okay and there are a lot of modes to keep anybody entertained for a year or so but it is quite clear 2k games are taking advantage of the fact they are the only ones making a basketball game. They don't care about quality anymore but I'm sure they thank you for your hard earned money you gave them.

Remember when 2k made good sports games and charged only $20 for them? Remember when the point of 2k sports games were to be more ""realistic"" than EA sports games? Well now we know if you give 2k games a little more power and leverage in the sports game market, they will abuse it.

The realistic feeling goes away real quick when your AI teammates are incredibly dumb, kick ball violations occur every couple of minutes, shots get blocked when a hand doesn't even touch the ball and the travelling. Oh the travelling in this game and how it is never called against a player.

The game is tolerable when playing a actual game of 5 on 5 but if you choose to play My career mode you are in for a rage fest. This is the most unfair, unpolished and for some reason, the most addicting mode in the game. I hated this mode so much but because I wanted to like it the most and because I constantly got screwed over by my dumb teammates, I just wanted to beat it. Also the mode will deliberately cheat you. Are you ready to get that rebound from a 3 point shooter? Well guess what, they will always make that shot no matter what so that's not going to happen. Want to get an assist? Too bad, your teammate is an idiot and 85% of the time will miss the shot. Want to make a free throw? Too bad, even though you made a ""great release"" you still will miss the shot. Did you do something good and got some points on your player grade? Well I really hope you don't make a single mistake because every mistake made in the game takes away more points on anything good you will do. Does that sound fun to you?

I am now at a point where I just don't want to waste any more time on this game and the My Career mode.

UPDATE MARCH 4TH, 2012

This is the first time I do an update on a review and the reason it's very simple, the idea behind this product it's good, but the design it's just wrong, after checking the temperature on my PS3 after playing 5 hours straight using this product, it was boiling hot, the back of my PS3 was extremely hot, so I decided to unplugged the ""cooler"". On a different day I played for another 5 straight hours with out the cooler, and the PS3 was warm, not hot as the day before. On both occasions I've had the PS3 on top of a laptop cooler, and the entertainment center is open on the back and front, so there's a good flow of air. I guess this product would be better if it had larger and faster fans like the modifications on the picture.

So my recommendation it's to place the PS3 on top of a laptop cooler, this gives a good flow of air to the intakes on the PS3, and also have it in a well ventilated area. My first PS3, 80 gig fat, lasted almost four years, and I used it for everything, now this one I just use for video games., so it should last a while longer than the first.",NOT GOOD AFTER A WHILE,1329004800,,,

Issue #1  Firmware doesn't work.  Keeps telling me No Razer Naga Epic connected, and closes on me.
Tech support doesn't know how to fix, still waiting on tier 2 to call me as they claim they would to resolve my issue.

Issue #2  If I ever use it wireless, it randomly stops working.  It takes about 5 minutes to start working on it's own, or if I connect it to the usb cable it takes a minute to connect IF that worked, sometimes that doesn't work and I have to disconnect it and reconnect it again.

 I've gone over this with tech support, and according to them there is no reason this should be happening, there's no issues they see with my computer.  I'm frustrated, and tired of waiting for them to contact me on an issue that they should have contacted me back on within one day.
I will give it 2 more days and if not contacted back by then, I will be returning it and not getting another one.

It was encompassing, awe inspiring, it had varied levels, it was pretty non-linear, the levels were lengthy yet doable.  It was basically a fun all around game.  So Jak 2 comes out, and they made a lot of changes, all for the worse.
First off, I guess the marketing folks told the developers to emulate Grand Theft Auto 3.  Let me tell you, this does not work.  GTA had a living-breathing city that fit into the environment.  What does Jak 2 have?  It was a non-descript closed off city with hardly anything in it.  The worst is the movement throughout the city.  To go to a different a different part of the city, you need take this horrible ""hover vehicle"" that apparently can't hover beyond ""up"" or ""down"".  The movements of this vehicle are sluggish, slow, and uncontrollable, and the vehicle itself doesn't possess any subtlety.  Couple this with the fact that all the missions are clear cross the city, and the alleyways are small, and you've got one boring, annoying game.  I passed maybe 10 levels, and most of my time was spent hovering between those levels.
Secondly, in GTA fashion, they decided to make it ""gritty"".  Oh geez, give me a break.  Who was begging for a cartoon platformer to be gritty?  Why does Jak need to cuss?  I don't mind it, but it serves no other purpose other than to alienate a chunk of potential gamers.  The ""gritty"" factor might have been an excuse as to why they could not re-produce the lush, varied environments that really made the first game.  Every level I played looked the same, either an indoor level or an outdoor level.
Okay, so the environment and movement is no good, what about the missions you say?  Well, these missions are tedious missions and designed to be repeated over and over again.  Some of the missions are easy, but you basically go through the same jumps and enemies over and over again.  Many are difficult, made so that you have to die a few times, repeat what you just accomplished, just to die a little bit later.  While not hard, but if the missions were any fun, it wouldn't be so bad.
Finally, the first game required you to reach a certain number of spheres for you to pass.  Whatever way you wanted to get them, you could.  This meant that if a mission was boring, not fun, or out of the way, you could skip and try something else.  This game pretty much is linear.  It's sort of de-evolution of video gaming right here.
So, in short, what was once an original, fun, lush platform game now spawned a sequel which is no more than a badly designed conglomeration or random gaming ideas.
Pros:
Uhmm, I can't think of any.
Cons:
Pretty much linear.
City is mundane.
Environments unvaried, stale.
Repetitive, tedious levels.

The beginnig starts with promise, a cool setting, cool upgraded environments and some interesting new characters.  But after the frst couple missions you realize the ""open world"" is extremely lifeless and linear. There's no identifiable change in scenery, you won't be able to tell one building from another and it all just feels boring and unpolished.

Runners Vision:
They say that there's many paths to get to one place but that's not true. There's only one path with the occasional option to do a wall run or a slide, but overall, free roam or mission, there's always only one path.  This is why you need to use ""runner's vision"" basically a gps system showing you where to go. But this is where I have one of the biggest complaints: the ""runner's vision"" breaks the flow. The way it works is that it will occasionally highlight a bar or pipe that you will need to grab in red and every couple seconds a red ""shade"" with fly in front of you highlighting your path. But they aren't consistent. Those red ledges only show up half the time and the red shade flies ahead of you and disappears.  So, often times you will turn a corner and there's no indication on where to go but you don't want to lose your stamina so you run in a random direction but it turns out to be wrong and you end up wasting time and losing all stamina. I turned off the shade a couple times but then you will become completely lost because remember, there's only one path to the destination! How they botched up one of the essential elements for assisting free running is beyond

""Logic & Physics? Wtv""
Another complaint is the story logic. As many people have complained about, the story here is boring and repetitive. I agree but would like to add that it doesn't even abide by logic. They just don't make any sense!  Why is there a bunch of people just standing on roof tops waiting for a runner to run by so they can ask for a delivery? and why are the receivers just 45 seconds to a minute away chilling on another rood top, and if you don't get there in time even when you're so close that they call out: ""runner, over here!"", the package ""expires""? (which contains things like flowers and letters) Also, the collectibles, why are there just yellow orbs all over the place? What the heck are they? What purpose do they carry? Same goes for the micro chips that I'm stealing from unprotected electrical boxes all over the city, what do they do? Why am I stealing them from even MY OWN HEADQUARTERS? And also, after the cops or ""Krugersec"" raids my headquarters and destroys it, why am I still able to use it as a safehouse? Heck, why won't they just stand on all the roofs and wait for me since they know all the runners just dash around those same buildings? so many questions, so little logic.

Combat
You probably will have to see a video to understand how amazingly stupid combat is in this game. Sense here, again, is abandoned. Like how does a kick to the enemy's face takes a little health, but if he stumbles back a couple steps into a partner he loses half his healthbar? And how can I roundhouse an Elite soldier and after he stumbles back 2 steps throw a kick two meters away but still get me? Combat is forced on you when you play and it definitely big the already wearysome experience.

Vertical Running
Almost all the missions, especially the important ones, take place in some tall building. This means that instead of free running, you will be climbing. Now I don't know about you, but I didn't buy this game for Far Cry style platforming. Jumping from one block to another then rotating around for 3 seconds finding the next pipe or ledge to grab to doesn't really feel like parkour, it feels like labor. But this is exactly what MEC fives you. The last mission in particular does this so much that at one point, you will have a whole 5 minutes of game time just grappling up from grapple point to grapple point like Batman. This to me is just a sign that the team behind the game was tired of their project and wanted to finish up with filler.

Lipsynch and Cutscenes
This is a minor complaint. I didn't mind the cutscenes so much because it was a chance to finally gives the characters more personality, and the graphics were actually pretty good. But lipsynch in most cutscenes are waaaay off, and the final cutscene where Faith showdowns with...., that whole segment started to get choppy and buffer. The game really does get worse and it saved the worst for last.

Conclusion
This game actually reminds me of that cell shaded prince of persia game for the ps3 in the late 2000s. Story was completely pointless as the ending undermines all your achievements, combat was tiring and unsatisfying, landscape was drab and illogical, and parkouring consisted of trial and error due to poor wayfinding.  Boy, I disliked that game.

ps. if you still insist on playing MEC, play with Faith in the elevator, there's usually a reflective black wall that can act as a mirror. you will see how awful she is rendered and for some reason you can see the back of her head when you turn quickly because apparently her eyes can turn around faster than her head.",As fluid as free running on crutches,1494028800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Given Nintendo's track record with this series and the absolute high quality of games for its new GameCube platform, I had every reason to think that ""Luigi's Mansion"", even if it was not up to the level of its predecessors, would be a quality entry in the series. I have to say that I was sorely disappointed.

I have a certain level of tolerance for games, even ones that are frustratingly slow and plodding, but I ran out of patience with this game. I could barely even get into playing it. From the very beginning, this game gets annoying. When Luigi first enters the mansion, he encounters this stupid little professor who is supposedly there to give Luigi the background of what is happening in the mansion and teach him to use this vacuum cleaner to capture the ghosts that haunt the mansion. Yet, the idiotic professor rambles for about 10 minutes worth of dialogue and THERE IS NO WAY TO BYPASS IT!! After each brief piece of dialogue, you have to hit a button to make it continue, too. So you just can't do something else while he rambles. But, I digress. You would think that once you get past that annoyance, you could just get right into the game. WRONG! Learning to use the vacuum cleaner is incredibly aggravating. The game doesn't give you any chance to develop a feel or flow for how to use it because every time you do anything with it THAT STUPID PROFESSOR STARTS YAPPING AGAIN!!! This, alone, caused me to put the game aside for about 8 months before trying it again. Once I finally exerted enough patience to get past this madness, I figured I would finally be able get into the game. Once again, I was wrong. I find that almost every door is locked and any method of getting through those doors is hidden somewhere on the board.

Half of the missions are impossible to finish unless you figure out some sort of gimmick. Most missions force you to research them on the Internet.
There is no sense of reality at all. For instance, at one point you are shooting into a giant frame of steel girders, but you can only fire when the ""doors"" are open, even though it's just a giant, open framework. There is a submarine that your weapons can't damage, so you have to lure enemy aircraft into crashing into it. Again, use the Internet to understand how to finish the missions.
Most missions have a wingman, and while you are trying to do your task, you often have to keep an eye on the wingman symbol to keep reminding them to go and do something. It's so distracting that it really detracts from the game.
The game introduces too many random elements of play. Instead of flying and shooting, some of the first things you do include tail gunning, using a bomb sight, and intercepting a train at just the right spot so that you can hover over it for several seconds. These might make nice diversions after several missions, but they are some of the first things you do and just add to the random, haphazard feel of the game.
There are several ""cheat codes"" available, but if you use them they lock out the achievements. I presume the cheat codes were released to make up for how difficult the game can be. Frankly, people ought to be able to finish a game. Publishers can certainly add some harder modes for re-playability, but it's just ridiculous to make a game difficult to understand just to add hours of play. On the plus side, the game rates your performance in each mission so you could re-play them for a higher rating. Also, your rating earns ""prestige points"" that are used to buy upgrades. You might find it necessary to earn more points just to get the upgrades for later missions.
The game booklet is worthless for understanding how to play the game. It doesn't explain how to use some of the more obscure controls and it doesn't explain the map symbols. You just have to play and lose until you gradually figure it out.
The plot is ridiculous. So ridiculous that it's annoying. The plot is explained through voice acting (not stellar, but I've heard worse) and artwork. Fairly crude.
Some of the missions are fairly enjoyable, as they aren't all timed and don't all require completing a bizarre task. But far too many of the missions are simply repeating the same frustrating sequence until you figure out some gimmick that isn't explained anywhere except an Internet post by someone who also got stuck.","many, many flaws",1329523200,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

It feels like a cheap toy gun, something that would be bought at a dollar store.  The power switch feels like it's going to break off, and I've only used it twenty or so times.  The handle is really fat and uncomfortable to hold (and I have large hands!)  All buttons are very cheap feeling, no microswitches here.  One of the side buttons was stuck in when I received it, and I had to pry it out to get it working.  The recoil is very light, and very loud.  Think a childs cap gun.  Also, the recoil sometimes cycles fully, sometimes only halfway, which can throw you off when gaming.  The drivers are next to impossible to install, as they're not digitally signed.  Unless you have a solid knowledge of windows driver structure, and are willing to put your computer into test mode, which leaves you open to attack, you won't even be able to get this working.  Once you get through that, you realize that you have to be at least 8 feet away from your monitor to calibrate the gun.  After about 6 hours of messing with settings, recalibrations, and repositioning its LED lights, I got it to work, but even at its best, the crosshair shakes badly, and one can't hit precise targets.  The lag between moving the gun and the crosshair moving is very noticeable.  Also, changing position AT ALL requires a recalibration.  Eats 4 good AA batteries (duracells) in under 3 hours of gaming. I have even tried this gun with third party drivers, (guncon2usb and wingun), no improvement. If I could return this, I would.

--USE WITH XBOX--
It seems that a common problem with these wireless headsets when used with Xbox is a high-pitched noise experienced by other users when the wireless headset is muted.  Another problem is that you practically have to shout into the microphone in order to be heard.  When I tested this product on Xbox Live, I was informed that my voice sounded faint or distant, even though I had the microphone within a half-inch of my lips.
I had a difficult time when switching between Xbox and phone use, as the headset would not connect very quickly to either, and would not allow people to hear me.  The high-pitched noise experienced by others was also present, but only on the Xbox side.

--USE OVER BLUETOOTH--
The Bluetooth range on this headset is terrible.  It seems that even the thinnest of materials interrupts the signal between the headset and the connected device.  When the headset was in my ear and my phone was in my front pocket, the signal would become intermittent.  I couldn't hear the person that I was on the phone with, and they couldn't hear me.  In order to keep the connection strong, I would have to hold my phone chest-level, which defeats the purpose of a headset.

--COMFORT--
The headset is not designed to fit into your ear canal, but is instead designed to fit into the opening of your ear.  I found that the headset was prone to falling out of my ear.  The rubber that went around the speaker irritated my ear beyond belief and I would have to reach up and scratch the inside of my ear.  The loop that fits around the outside of the ear was a little big for me and didn't hold on tightly enough for my taste.

--OVERALL--
I cannot recommend this product at all.  It's uncomfortable, has spotty connectivity, and the microphone is awful.  The microphone has no noise cancelling and I received frequent complaints about wind noise, even when there was no wind to speak of.  The only good thing about this headset was the battery life (around 8 hours), which isn't even that great to begin with.

Plus I was a huge fan of the new Grand Theft Auto 5 game. So when the concept of the people who made Assassin's Creed were making a Grand Theft Auto style game, I was all over it. But I'm afraid to say that I just didn't like the game at all. I guess the best way to describe this game, is exactly the way that the guy at Gamestop described it to me ""It doesn't really do anything well, it's all just ok."" Nothing is more close to the truth then this. And it's VERY frustrating, because it feels like a step backwards for the company because of this. The game feels very sluggish to me, there is nothing fluid about it. From the driving to the stealth and moving around. I'm not sure if this is due to lack of attention, or simply inexperienced people working on this title. Plus another further thing that is REALLY annoying. You can't customize the controls, and the way they have some of these controls set up, you scratch your head wondering if they even realized how inconvenient some of the button placements were. An example of this is the power break being the O button and X being to look behind your vehicle (logically you'd make X your power break since it's easier to reach). Then when you go into the options menu, under control schemes, it gives you 4 total options. The default for right handed people, and THREE, count em, THREE Left handed options for Left Handed players. Let me tell you something I AM Left handed, and I would NEVER play the game with the controls they have set for lefties. I think video game developers don't seem to realize that left handed people are raised in a world designed for right handed people, meaning anything you can do with your right hand, we can pretty much do, with the exception of writing. So yea they should have focused more on giving different variations to regular right handed controls.

I do, however, read reviews and I tend to watch game play trailers and the like, so I do research my purchases. I also think I am fairly easy to please. That said, its been a long time since I have disliked something this much, and so quickly.

The graphics are some of the worst I have ever seen, and I have everything cranked all the way up. Return to Castle Wolfenstien looked better than this.... years ago. Not only are the environments utterly boring, but they are rendered at a quality that is easily being surpassed by even the least graphic-intensive games of the last two or three years.

Graphics are not everything though, and were that my sole complaint, I'd not bother with a review.

There is apparently no such thing as enemy AI. Get in front of the completely random assortment of ""demons,"" most of which look like rubber toys with teeth, and _sometimes_, if they aren't too buy roaming aimlessly back and forth, they might attack. They can also apparently walk through any obstacle in their path should they choose to engage you, including buildings- and by walk through them, I mean ""as if they are not there"". Not that it matters. I played for a couple of hours and fought dozens and dozens of utterly random monsters and never came anywhere near getting killed.

The dialog is unbelievably juvenile and utterly silly, and the character animations during said dialog are about 2 seconds long, endlessly repetitious, and look like they were choreographed by a two year old. If there is a ""story"" to this game, I have yet to figure out what it is.

The quests, so far, are also ridiculous, extremely simple, and highly unimaginative. I have heard people complain about the ""fetch this, get that"" quests in other RPG style games like Oblivion, but this game is nowhere near the quality of Oblivion in any way whatsoever.

Seriously, I almost never post negative reviews, but this is ridiculous. Maybe I am missing something... perhaps if I was nostalgiac for Diablo I would get the joke, but as it stands, as a game on any level, I cannot find a single good thing to say about this title.

Also, theres a'little TOO much ""humor"" for such a violent movie game.

Marella praises the game's charater designs, but the gameplay is far too linear in this era of gaming.. that's weak. It doesn't take much effort to make a game that parody's other games and has a non-existant un-original plot.. anyone could do this.

DRM has hurt this game more than any other game before it.  D3 was a blessing compared to SC2013.

Pros:

- The cities are half decent looking graphically

Cons:

- *Small complaint but stupid nonetheless* You are forced to play the tutorial even if you know how to play the game- this doesn't sound like a big issue (and its more of a nuisance) but early on in the game with the server issues it meant I had to play the tutorial 4 times before I could start a city... a tutorial I'd already played 100x during beta weekends... fail

- Cities won't load and there's no apparent fix - this was the simple inability to load my cities... period.  There was no other option, I could abandon them and come back a week later and re-claim and they would still not load.  It was not 1... or 2... or even 3 cities, it was many many cities.

- Game requires too much bandwidth - If you are downloading something or have family members streaming movies and such expect your cities to constantly have issues and need to be rolled back.

- Cities need to be constantly rolled back - even if it's not a bandwidth issue you'll find that EA want's you to constantly roll back your progress.

- No way to save your progress - expect EA to know exactly when to save... even though they wont.  Next time you kick on your game play the guessing game ""how many minutes will I have to replay""

- No way to roll back the game on your own - Can't roll-back your own city progress to undo something you've done by accident or to experiment and see ""what will this do""

- Way too much ""work"" - You'll learn to get sick of the bulldozer RRREAALLLL quick... people abandon buildings too fast and they constantly need to be destroyed. Oh and, patch 2.0 made it to where people will abandon places MORE often.

- The games finances do not seem to scale well - I haven't had to ability to test the numbers (due to cities not loading and a pure dis-interest in the game) but I found it amazing how hard it was to make $$$ with cities that had 350k people when there was very little difference in the cities infrastructure from when it was racking in the dough with 250k or 150k residents.

- Traffic is a joke - It's pretty funny how sims will spend the better part of 12 hours stuck at an intersection.... the game has no resemblance of how anything really works... I don't want to ""avoid 4 way intersections"" or ""make 1 long road that curves so you have no intersections""... are you kidding me?

- Traffic is a joke pt2 - 1 major highway into the city? gggreeaattttt.

- Cities are too small - You can read all about it elsewhere... It's true, there's no denying it.

- No terraforming

- Residents unhappy over stupid stuff - 350k people ""worried about crime""... check crime map... 3 crimes a day... ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Oh and, after patch 2.0 people will get upset MORE easily... greattttt.

Ehhh, thats enough for me.  There were a lot of bright points to the game but they get squelched by just about everything.

The only star this game gets goes directly to Amazon.com for allowing refunds to continue even today, weeks after the 30 day deadline... I waited until patch 2.0 to see if my cities would be useable because I simply had zero desire to create new ones. I'd already made 20 cities and there's not enough diversity in this game to justify getting myself back to where I was just to have the maps lost in an infinite limbo again. Yes a few of my maps load, but when big cities are so reliant on the ones around them to provide services and those maps simply won't load, every grouping ended up broken.

1.0,True,"11 15, 2010",A1CE9259TTIIEA,B003O6EFKI,Monsieur Mouton,"I have played a handful of MMORPGS, largely FFXI and WOW, but a few others as well. My preference for online games are those lush in aesthetic detail, with involved combat, and which are readily accessible to both casual and hardcore gamers. I had long felt FFXI was sorely lacking on the last of those two marks, but had a great deal of both scenic and narrative detail. My hopes that XIV would remedy the ills of XI and improve upon its better qualities never materialized in the finished product. XIV is a shallow game, glutted with repetition, a cumbersome user interface, and a combat and crafting system both tedious and ungratifying.

XIV's world, Eorzea, is massive even to other Final Fantasy entries. Unfortunately, one quickly finds that the terrain is almost ceaselessly unvarying. The starter regions are, befitting to Final Fantasy's emphasis on graphical beauty, impressive. But one look is all one needs to have seen the full extent of any of these areas, or any of those a player will later come upon. There are no areas that break up the unremitting terrain, like WoW's forests, lakes, camps, villages, etcetera, and no alteration to the single loop of music as you travel. Monsters too, though they change in name and level, rarely change in models. More disappointing are the starter city's, especially Limsa Lominsa, which looks blocky and unfinished. Ul'Dah is a drab city built like a race course, moving in circles through corridors of recurrent grays and browns. Despite being more functional and easier to travel than XI's starter cities, they lack any memorable character or life, especially when compared to more contemporary MMORPGs. The setting is only complimented by an interesting storyline, a rarity amongst most online games.

Gameplay is FFXIV's most pivotal failure. Leveling a class, which is determined by the weapon you have equipped, is done purely by grinding mobs or performing a limited set of quests. These quests are truly the only viable way to progress, but an individual is restricted to how many they may take in a real 24 hour period. Even when these quests, the so-called `guild leves,' are meant to be difficult and attempted only with a group, they end quickly and require little skill. They are also exceedingly unoriginal, requiring killing x amount of mobs or collecting x amount of items. You've seen the full gambit of quests by the time you're in your teen levels, but are forced to repeat them if you've any intention of leveling further. Crafting, which is markedly improved from XI, is also needlessly complex, risky, and boring. Progressing as a craftsman will entail a great many failures. Your skill level has a bearing on your chance of success, but a prevailing capriciousness within the system seems to work against you more than not. Buying and selling goods crafted or not, is truly cumbersome. There is no auction house, nor a way to search for items.

Ultimately, XIV is a disappointing, exceedingly shallow game with a limited variety of eye candy and a few glimpses of a good story holding it up.

My first impression was WOW!  Graphics were impressive albeit somewhat grainy as AA is not supported.  Lots of very cool water and blur effects.  The atmosphere is somewhat original.  Has a 1940s/50s art deco thing going.  Victrola playing in the background, Nazi scientists, surgical theaters... the whole shebang.  That aspect of the game was very well done.  The rest of it though, I can only sum it up as ""sensory overload"".

The games for genesis were ground-breaking & the computer games perfected the realistic feel.  That said, this is the WORST NHL hockey game i have ever played & i've played every single one (so i'm a video game nut).  The game is virtually ruined by the slow gamepace.  the players skate very slowly, especially when they have the puck.  if you have a breakaway, you can bet that someone will hack you down (or just kind of skate around you) before you get close to the goalie.  So considering that the defense skates twice as fast as the offense you would think that you may get some nice checks & physical gameplay... wrong!  the checking is mild & unrealistic.  It doesn't even account for momentum.  This means that a standing check is just as devastating as a check where you have a running head start.  Even the original NHL back in '92 accounted for this.

1.0,False,"11 28, 2015",A2XVA2OGDYKKD,B00YQ2KCWO,Monsieur Valentine,"I see the irony of it all, during the introduction of fallout 4. Yes I am cynical as a fan of fallout 1. Alas, as if I too remember a time of innovation and technology. A time before the war, before Bethesda bought out the franchise, took to the courts and won the rights to never let the original creators come near the game again. And now, now I live in a post-apocalyptic world where scattered remnants of junk on my PS4 hint of a golden era that once existed. An era of sophistication and intelligence. That is the irony of fallout and the fate of the original game.

Now a shell of a game, empty and frail. A primitive version of its itself. The only things holding this universe together are bits and pieces of what it carries from the original in 1997. Anything remotely impressive are flashes of innovation from 20 years ago. The turn based Vats system with action points,  PipBoy, perks, stats, vaults. These are all inventions of a team who thrived decades ago.

I ask myself, after all these years, what did Bethesda bring to this franchise, other than a FPS perspective?

Nothing. It has done nothing. Actually it has done more than nothing. The heart and soul of this game has long perished.

The original concept was a tarantino-esque amalgamation of artistic styles. Influences from post-apocalyptic movies like  A Boy and His Dog, Mad Max, The Omega Man, Forbidden Planet, and drawing inspiration from 1950's comic books and magazines. Set in a retro-future stuck in a pseudo-atomic age. And behind the unapologetic photo-realism of violence (guts spraying, heads exploding, limbs blowing off) there was this ever so lovable tongue in cheek humor, infused in the graphical interface, the storyline and in the characters that were encountered. The whole thing was oozing with charisma. Take away the gaming mechanics, the world itself was an astonishing piece of work. In my childhood, in my mind, in 1997, dare I say the creators of fallout were as inspirational to me as George Lucas was for Star Wars fans.

Where is that now? The game is dull and boring. Look at some of the artwork of the original Fallout games, and compare it to the polygons of fallout 4. Much of the problem is the static nature of gaming engines over the last decade. The architecture is at a dead end. Still working with polygons. While I was sitting there choosing my face, my girlfriend walked by and mentioned  'The Sims'. This isn't suppose to be 'The Sims'. Your character should not be a blank empty canvas. He should be a full fledged beautiful character for you to explore and develop. Instilled with the brooding presence of Mel Gibson, or maybe the smirk laden Harrison Ford, or the awkwardness that was Malcolm Reynolds. That after all was the heart and soul of fallout. A comic. Full of life, color and personality. Not this stale heap of polygons.

Or better yet, give us something more than what they could back in 1997. Let the character develop a personality depending on your actions throughout the game. Maybe having a boat load of charisma could actually have a profound effect on the narrative of your character. Dare I say actually charismatic. Or maybe a boat load of intelligence would treat us with the prize of controlling a witty protagonist that makes off-the-cuff remarks that could leave us in stitches. Or maybe firing up your player with 10+ brute strength could gift us Schwarzenegger toting one liners. But it doesnt do that. Because this game has not a single ounce of balls.  Instead, every time, the interactions are centered around a handful of homogeneous responses. Traveling a desolate landscape. And yes for some reason, post-apocalyptic means desolate and bland for Bethesda, when in reality such a world should be anything but that. It should be engaging, dangerous, sometimes chaotic, sometimes beautiful, sometimes dark, sometimes colorful. It should be alot of things.

Instead Fallout 4 doesnt even know what it wants to be anymore. Its a mess. Its part 'world of warcraft', part 'Morrowind', part 'Gears of war' part this part that. Just clutching to the artwork of vault boy.

Now a multi-million dollar franchise, Bethesda could not even bother to invest in a half decent story. There's a ticket offered to secure a vault, minutes later the bombs go off, and you get in the vault. That sort of story telling has no place in the 21st century. I truly feel sad for anyone who feels compelled by such a narrative. How does this go unnoticed in all these pages and pages of 5 star reviews.

For me, the final nail in the coffin was the moment I realized I feel absolutely nothing for my canine pal. NOTHING. ZERO. There is not a moment of humanity in it. No substance, no happiness, no laughter, no kinship. This dog merely exists as canon fodder. And in many ways it sums up my experience with fallout 4. If the original creators of fallout had the opportunity to write this game, I am sure this dog would not have only been my best friend, but probably a pop culture icon by now.

....an easter egg perk that lets you talk to your smart ass dog. That would have been a fantastic throwback. These are the kinds of things that this game is missing and the reason why so many fans of the original are tortured.

This year you have absolutely no control or influence over your be a pro player. You cannot adjust height, wieght or any xp points. You simply pick a power forward etc.. and play. This lacks any excitement in building your profile and experimenting with combinations.  As others have stated it's NHL 14/15. The game hasn't changed in years. Same animations, dekes, moves, hits etc.. Don't expect to be able to create custom uniforms anymore either, that's gone.

Twice now, during an EASHL club game we crashed to the home screen. Everyone on my team immediately and at the same time crashes to the xbox one home screen. This results in a loss and we're starting to wonder if this is the resurgence of the old loop glitch from NHL 11. Both times we were spanking the other team. They would  pause the game at a fact off and boom, game crash.

Most of EA games seemingly have been focused 100 percent around HUT  or some sort of ultimate team. This is where the kids spend all their mom's money from the credit card. I can't speak about HUT this year because I don't play it. Last year hut was full of.glitches and just not worth it. This game just went backwards. Same old same old year after year getting worse and worse.

And for all you fan boys out there, do you realize going through reviews and clicking ""not helpful"" doesn't actually make the game any better? Clicking 5 stars and getting angry when others do not agree does nothing to motivate improvment. You just accept less quality for more money year after year. I don't find any 5 star reviews legitimate other than the fan boy mentality, however I respect your point of view and find your time helpful.

It's now the reason I'm selling the console back. For some background, When I was 12-13 years old I played Halo: CE and here and there played Halo 2 with friends that owned the game. I spent maybe 15-20 hours on the original Halo games included in the MCC. Also, I did play the s*** out of Halo: Reach and it remains one of my favorite games to date. I had high expectations for the MCC because of Reach and have been severely disappointed.

As of 12/1/14:

* Multiplayer is screwed up. I've been able to get into 4 matches. One was 5v2, one 2v0, one 1v0. The last was actually 8v8 and it was fun, but I don't think I'd be playing it much. The red vs blue gives a very old vibe that is fairly boring.

* Graphics look good compared to the original games, but I expected a lot more. Compared to newer great looking games like Destiny, Assassins Creed (Black Flag... haven't tried Unity), and even The Last of Us, Halo graphics are kinda pathetic.

* Texturing... ugh. I've never thought I cared much about texturing until I played this game. Halo MCC looks sparse and bland, especially CE and 2.

* This might be a little controversial to some of you, but I do not care for the campaigns. Halo: Reach's story was absolutely amazing and I was totally engrossed in the probably 12 times I played through it. I feel almost bored going through CE, 2, 3, and 4 missions. Out of them all, I'm enjoying 2 and 3 the most.

* Playing with friends can be a frustrating experience when connecting with one another. Some kinks need to be worked out where if the party leader leaves a mission (or a multiplayer lobby), the rest of the group should too. There are lots of little problems like that. Also, it takes a long time for the friends list to even load and sometimes friends that I'm chatting with in a party (and are in game) do not appear on the list.

* I am not happy with the control setups available to me. I've been playing a good bit of Destiny and BF4, and going to Halo controls has been an annoying experience. I'd very much like to be able to assign my own controls how I like them if popular layouts aren't offered.

* Actual gunplay is frustrating. I like having a very precise reticle so I know exactly what I'm shooting at (mostly for headshots) and the reticles in Halo MCC aren't fulfilling. Other games, I usually kill with headshots 70% of the time in multiplayer and 80-90% in single player/coop. In Halo, single player/coop is probably around 20%.

I'm usually a skeptic so spending $60 on all this amazing content that was being advertised was pretty out-of-character and it should have been a red flag. I'll not make that mistake again. I will say that if you are a big fan of Halo, you'll probably eat this game up and love it. But for those of you who don't have an attachment to previous Halo games and are looking for current-gen quality, don't get your hopes up. If they fix the problems and the price goes down to $30ish, you should buy this game.

This means if you want a rematch you have to write down your opponents name, enter it manually, and hope they accept and haven't already started another fight. 99% of the time that's too much effort for anyone to bother. Rematches are what makes quick matches fun, because you can play around the first time, then play serious if you lose.

As far as gameplay, it's not much of an improvement. The striking is ok, the grappling is weird and you constantly get frozen in positions for a short time which just makes everything look awkward. Apparently nobody knows how to throw anything but slow motion hammer fists on the ground.

EA also still hasn't figured out what a knock out is or when a fight should be stopped. You can literally fold someone in half against the cage, as their lifeless body just kind of slides to the ground. Then they will miraculously come back to life, all while the ref looks on doing nothing. Honestly you have absolutely no idea when you knock someone down whether they are out cold, hardly hurt, or badly stunned. You mostly have to just wait and see if they reanimate, or listen to Rogans comments for clues. WTF EA. If a fighter is knocked limp and lifeless, the fight is over.

I love the art style, and the storyline was good, and the action/adventure style was really enjoyable. Restoring nature to desolate areas was really rewarding just because of how vibrant the game is, seeing flowers and animals pop up in areas where there was nothing but ash and rock was visually amazing, and this is coming from a life-long gamer.

That said, I enjoyed playing this game up until I had to restore the big tree with the old guy that was dancing a shuffle. The execution of these cutscenes was horrible. First off, the bug has to shut up. He is worse than Navi from Ocarina of Time. You could skip through Navi's blathering by jabbing the A button, but the Bug in Okami refuses to let you cut him off - you must listen to every one of his words creep across the screen and it is very, very frustrating.

Then in the cutscenes where you have to assist people cutting/restoring things in the world, you have only a split-second to actually help them, and if you screw up (which is often because the brush feature is bugged) you have to listen to their blather all over again, and as I just mentioned, you have no opportunity to skip it.

As for the brush feature, it works about half of the time. At least with the wii-mote. I'm not sure about the gamecube version, I haven't played it. But it just doesn't work half the time, I can draw a straight line across something, and it won't work. I can repeat the same exact brush stroke a second time, and then it will work. The same goes for restoring trees with a circle. I can draw a circle, and it won't work. I do it again, and it does. Restoring or cutting things on the field isn't that big of a deal because you can indefinitely repeat your brushstrokes, however in the cutscenes it becomes a major issue because you have to do it perfectly 3 or 4 times in a row.

So I get to the restore-the-big-tree deal with the old guy and he blathers on about this being a super-secret dance and I get to the cutscene:

I draw a circle around the first flower bud. It works.
I draw a circle around the second flower bud, and it makes a sun in the sky instead. I fail.

As of 2014 the Wii no longer has the ability to access the internet. Since AC: City Folk 100% REQUIRES an active internet connection to function, this means the game is borderline unplayable.
The 'City,' the focal point of this game, is unavailable to visit. Meaning quests, items, vendors, special events, etc etc etc aren't available to you. You're stuck in your town. You are a prisoner there.

1.0,False,"11 2, 2016",A9QZGSWH9MW0W,B01GKGVIB2,E. Powell,"I would've given this two stars, but there's entirely too much to hate as compared to the original.

I absolutely loved the first TF. When I heard they were launching it, I nearly lost my mind. Then, I played the beta. I was beyond heartbroken. They essentially gutted the spirit of what made TF1 so beautiful. They essentially remade the game into something akin to a Call of Duty: Black Ops in Space

So, against my better judgment, I bought the game anyway. I played the multiplayer for about four hours. I seriously wanted nothing more than to like the sequel. I even tried to force myself to play it for about 2-hours longer than when I became bored.

ARTWORK

Some things are better looking such as the lobby animations. However, overall, the artwork doesnt give that detailed gritty feeling that you got from the original. Theres a lot less detail and the maps are much smaller.

Furthermore, the maps are NOT geared towards the parkour movement of the original. The maps are just not well designed for the feel of what one would expect to be a Titanfall branded game.

In TF-1, the colors are muted and realistic looking. In TF-2, things look cartoony with a loud color palette. You feel like you're at an arcade playing one of those shooters with the toy rifles and everything is just coming at you in all the colors of the rainbow.

GAMEPLAY

Instead of a blanket upgrading system where your upgrades allow you access to certain weapons, theyve added more granularity by making weapons upgradable as well. So, you might start with a Level 1 rifle that can be leveled up and upgraded accordingly. This is while you're leveling up as a pilot which allows you access to more advanced weapons in each class.

The titans weapons and characteristics cannot be interchangeable in the way that we saw with TF1. Some of the secondary abilities can be changed. However, titans can be upgraded within the context of their static loadout. So, what you see is what you get for the most part. I actually like that I could use three different chassis and arm them with customizable loadouts. To me, this seemed like a better way to adapt/develop the choices to ones play style. With TF-2, I pretty much have to commit to a certain Titan vs a certain package of features.

The final straw for me was the implementation of the shield dome. In TF-1, if you called on a Titan, youd have a shield dome protecting the Titan for a short period of time. You could get a Titan customization that could extend this time. Now, in TF-2, you either get the shield dome or the titan warp customization. Why is this important? If you're trying to make a tactical move involving a Titan that you cant immediately jump into, then you're SOL. Your Titan falls and is immediately taking damage.

There aren't as many of the Grunts and Androids to kill. I liked these because it was cool to shoot them. Many dislike the Smart Pistol, but I loved it as a primary weapon. It actually increased the hazard of the warzone. It made you a better player if someone was using it against you and there wasn't a guarantee that you would dominate if you were using it. Now, its been completely neutered as a perk that can only be used with 24 rounds. Wow. Just wow.

Speaking of primary weapons. Heres where the absurdity of the game decisions reaches a pinnacle. Pilots can ONLY carry a primary weapon and  wait for it  a pistol OR anti-titan weapon!!! So, yeah, you run out of ammo on your primary weapon and no quick switching to a nice pistol if you want to kill Titans also. So, theyve effectively neutered the pilot. [Game developers, what were you thinking?]

CUSTOMIZATION

Theyve added more customization abilities such as the ability to reskin your weapons and your Titan. This includes patches and team names. What I don't like about it is that it seems like they just through this feature on without much thought on the actual UI. Its a bit confusing to implement.

Did I say you can only have two weapons at a time while a pilot? Primary + pistol or primary + Anti-Titan?

SUMMARY

I could go on about other things. This game feels like they fired the original team during early development. Then hired a whole new team that never worked on or played the original. This new team was confused so they looked over the notes of the previous team and then made the best game that they could. Another theory is that since they went multiplatform, they couldn't use Microsoft's  Azure cloud abilities to do much of the heavy backend lifting as was the case in the original. Hence, they had to make a lite game and used the COD: Black Ops resources/model to fill in the gaps.","If Youre Passionate About Titanfall 1, Then DO NOT Get Titanfall 2!",1478044800,4,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

I debated getting this on the PS3 because I played and earned a platinum trophy on Darksiders 1, but as I built a new PC recently, I wanted to give the PC version a try. I regret that decision.

The PC port is (surprise!) shockingly bad. Video options are limited to resolution and vsync on/off (no joke). And you have to actually start a game and get through the initial story before you finally take control of the main character, Death. Only then can you pause the game and actually configure settings for the first time, and even then the game requires a restart just to change resolution and Vysnc on/off. Unacceptable. Side note: it took 3 restarts before my options finally took and the game finally rendered at my desired resolution.

Enabling VSYNC in-game is currently broken. I found this out when my within two minutes of playing my GTX570's fan spun up like a get engine. I alt-tabbed to windows and saw its fan maxed out at 85% (this particular card only goes up to 85% for some reason) with temps in the mid 90c range! I've seen this happen before with other games (Dead Island for example) so I knew the problem was broken VSYNC. Now, the game looks great, but not THAT great so as to put a GTX570 into the 90c temperature range within 2 minutes of playing the game. I also noticed a lot of screen tearing, another telltale sign of disengaged VSYNC. I also tried two other lower resolutions and all 3 settings were over-stressing my GPU.

There are indications everywhere that the minimum effort was given to this console port. The in-game inventory menu is stuck at console resolutions (1280 x 720) so if you're running any higher than that (I game at 1080p) everything is upscaled, pixelated and unsightly. During the game's many QTE sequences, or when you pick up loot dropped in the game, the on screen button prompts are also locked at console resolution, so they too look pixelated and upscaled.

The MINIMUM effort was given for this port. I wish I could get a refund for the PC version and pick up the PS3 version instead, at least then I'd be working on my trophies.

On the positive side, the game seems really fun so far. It plays great with the PC 360 controller and has a very pretty art design and graphics. Unfortunately I now have to go out of my way and look for workarounds for the quality issues that the developer should have done.

Maybe that is why ASB seems so horrible to me, because it does not even compare in any way to MVP. First of all, the good things about ASB are the ""This week in baseball"" feature and the franchise mode seems impressive, but the most important thing, the gameplay, is absolutley pitiful. It is impossible to field ground balls. Almost everything gets through the infield. The pitching in ASB is easier than MVP, but it gives you less control over your pitches. The sound is pathetic compared to MVP. It's muffled and dull, the commentators ramble, the player reactions are stupid, many of the batter stances are totally off. The crowd looks terrible and makes almost no noise, unlike in MVP where you can hear the fans saying stuff like ""can i get a hot dog over here"" or the vendors in philly saying ""cheese steak, get your cheese steak."" ASB has none of that. One thing that ASB has on MVP is that the mound visit is better because it gives details on how the pitcher is doing and on the upcoming hitters, but the player attributes are way off. Javy Lopez is given ""weak hitting"" and Pokey Reese is given ""weak speed!"" Are you kidding me!?!?! By they way, the music in ASB sucks, unlike MVP which actually pays real bands to use their music. Another plus for MVP is that there are several different slides you can do in MVP, like hook, head first,(each to both sides of the bag), pop-up, and of course foot first. In ASB you can do straight head first or foot first only. Overall, ASB gets a one out of 10, purely because of it's realistic franchise mode, but EA's MVP gets a 9/10, so DON'T waste your money on ASB! GET MVP AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! By the way, I also wrote a separate review for MVP if you're interested. But there's something I don't understand: Why isn't Kevin Millar in either game?

1.0,False,"05 17, 2012",AVVIJ7EBPS4EI,B00178630A,Dave,"I really enjoyed D1 and D2, as most people did to make them the landmark games they were. D3 is certainly inspired by these two games, but aside from similar proper noun names, and the general gameplay there is no relation. D3 has gone in a different direction art-wise, and though I preferred the more ""realistic"" look of the first two, I can say that there are truly some amazing views, and you have to respect the creativity and dedication that went into making this game's graphics. -Mostly a personal opinion, though given my initial hesitance, I would say most people could enjoy it moderately.

Music and sound effects are great, it adds a lot to the experience.

Monsters are misplaced transfers from the first two - mostly the same creatures, moved into different environments. There are some new surprises and the skills and abilities that they have are fairly interesting. The only challenge comes from monsters being totally over powered - there's no tactics. While the isometric view is at times pretty and in the vein of Diablo series, it's not particularly easy to work with World of Warcraft raid mechanics.

If you've raided in world of warcraft, you've beat the bosses in Diablo 3. They're good fights, but I played WoW long enough to tell you where each of the boss abilities comes from - nothing new here.

Character abilities first seem totally uncustomizeable. At about nightmare difficulty, lvl 30-40 you start to think that there's actually a lot of customization that you're going to get. The skill and rune combinations are massive. Unfortunately, most of them are prohibitive to play, it takes forever to change them and the UI - responded to ad nausea during the beta, is made for a young child. Not the adult, mature rated game with lots of gore and a little nudity.

Overall, you'll probably enjoy it for the first play through if you liked the other Diablo games. If you just appreciate it as an ""inspired by"" as opposed to a sequel. But it get's old fast, even if you start playing after Activision Blizzard manages to get their login and game play servers working. Until then, expect to lag out of a ""single player"" game. Expect to lose achievements and character records, and expect to die a lot from lag. They'll either fix it (I hope and imagine) or after people have beat the game, and no longer want to sell items for a million gold two days after release (the economy is going down fast in this game... way too many resources, no gold sinks, use and sell rares, recover every gem you've ever made...)

If you have the money to spare, and want to support a once brilliant company that has been bought out and is all about the money now, go ahead. You'll probably have a decent time. But there are way better games, with much more to offer, for less than this that you should really turn your attention to.

-Update-
Just wanted to add, that with the first hot fix, Blizzard is changing character skills and abilities, but not the in-game tooltips. There are no fixes for server lag, disconnects, and deaths due to lagging out.
They are causing anyone who was used to playing a class, alone or with other people in strictly co-op (no PvP yet!!) to have to adjust to modified skills and abilities. The tinkering of an always on, always patched game become apparent.
If you didn't dislike a lot about this game already, the unavoidable re-balancing, modifications of characters, and the lack of any sort of in-game update to ability descriptions should definitely put you off.

First and foremost, EA already has admitted that they rushed this game out to compete with COD:Ghosts, which is NOT fair to the consumers. When you rush a game, it's usually plagued with bugs and will cause a backlash with everyone. Indeed, the first 60 days of ownership I was unable to play for more than 15 minutes at a time without the game crashing. People demanded fixes but it took them at least 2 months to provide a somewhat stable game. I still have issues to this day with being disconnected from servers with no letigimate reasons, other than vague ones EA has chosen to use. Other games, you could at least get a better idea.

Next, the community themselves. A majority of the users on the battlelog forum remind you of a daycare center, hurling insults when you ask a question, providing idiotic answers to questions like 'I get disconnected from a server for no reason'. To add insult to injury, a majority of them think they are computer experts, when they are far from it (I write software professionally and I am involved in Open Source projects for Drivers and the likes for a major international conglomerate). If you casually read any threads, they start off with a legitimate question but quickly turn into a insult laden post where everyone has to be the loudest in the room.

Next, the actual design of the game. The first thing a normal FPS /should/ have, is you start it up, then select a server from within the game. This monstrosity makes you use a web browser plugin to execute code (the game), seriously? Talk about a Security Risk! Then there's the lack of configuration options from within console like other games (Quake 3, for example, or CSS, et al) so you have no idea what any of the limited console commands do.

Next, The lack of communication from EA themselves on their own forum. They do not admit the game has problems, but they admit on Reddit there are issues with the Networking Engine that causes the game to become desynced with the server, and other issues. Why wasn't these issued addressed before the launch? Also, In various demos they had MUCH more 'eye candy' (the grass and the likes), but it was turned off in the game for no reason to us who forked out almost $100 for the game and it's addons. The maps are not even remotely fun, and they are small compared to some of the Battlefield 3 maps.

Next, the balance of the game. In multiplayer, Helicopters can take multiple stingers and still survive. HAH! That is one of the many examples of a game that had potential to be OK, but failed.

Then there's Punkbuster, the ring0 (root) spyware that looks through your files, even when you are not playing a game. Punkbuster is the most intrusive software ever created, and scans /all/ processes on your computer for signs of cheat programs. Of course, people will defend it, because hey, what's a tiny little program that sits in the background going to do exactly? What would occur if EB's servers were compromised? That would possibly create the largest botnet in the history of the Internet, because the PB software /requires/ ADMIN privileges to be installed. This is just as bad as DCOM being enabled on Windows machine (and exploited in the early 00s)

EA is in the process of being sued in a class action manner due to their botched release. I expect nothing will happen as EA will bring in their corporate lawyers to make this all go away, since we, the consumer, are their beta testers. EA as a company is one of the worst ones in the history of gaming, /every/ game they (EA) have their name around, ends up in a massive failure or average metacritic reviews. (Look at the SimCity botched release for example).

When I first bought the game it was a nice change to be able to go to different parts of the Sim world. It was a welcomed change. However, that was before I discovered all the glitches and bugs this expansion pack introduced to my Sims 3 game. I deeply regret buying it.

A few things that have gone wrong since I installed it:

- If a Sim has been in an area too long (ie Egypt) that sim will out of nowhere have a family located in that area. My sim girl was in Egypt a lot because the mummies and tombs were fun to me. After a while I looked at the family tree and she's somehow already married to an old man and they have a kid together? What the?! I can't break up the marriage so she can't marry anyone ever. (See Picture I Uploaded)

- My sim guy ""went steady"" with a girl from China. When he got home, the girl disappeared so now my guy can't marry anyone because it still shows that he's in a relationship with this girl. I can't reach her by phone or go to China because she vanished.

- There is a car stuck outside my sim's homes and I can't do Move Objects On to remove it.

- If my Sim asks a foreign sim (from China for example) to get married, the game glitches so that they marry but the Chinese sim doesn't move in. I can keep marrying them but they never move in, it just glitches and sends them flying around the house.

- Lastly, the glitch that made me upset the most is that I was in Egypt exploring tombs when all of a sudden the game glitches and nothing, I mean NOTHING, is clickable anymore. I can't use my cell to get out of there, I can't make my sim walk anywhere because not even the floors are clickable. I just said forget it and quit the game.

These glitches have ruined the game for me. It was a big mistake trying out the game with my favorite family. Now they're all messed up and I cant do anything to fix it. This expansion pack was MAJOR FAIL. I advise you NOT to get it and only do so when *everything* is fixed. Save your money until then! The game itself is pretty fun if you're looking to trying new things and introduce new challenges for you and your sim but like I said, it's better to wait until its problems are fixed.

Update 7/14/10: Might I add that since writing this review I've had to restart a new game from scratch 3 times.

-Gives you a whole new menu.
-is a complete step closer to being a cpu

Between the two, I've probably bought over 100 different video games through Amazon for a dozen different game systems and computers.  The Orange Box is, without a doubt, the WORST game purchase I have ever made here.  Not only do I feel completely cheated, not only do I feel as if I am in fact owed several hundred dollars in frustration fees, I actually think my overall interest in video games has been damaged by this monstrous piece of marketing vomit masquerading as a playful gamer utopia.  That is how ridiculous this piece of Trojan Horsed garbage is.

The culprit is a smarmy little ferret of a program called ""Steam"".  I don't know who came up with this, but I hope they get hit by a bus and buried in a fire ant den.  Simply put, ""Steam"" is an Orwellian nanny program that requires you to basically convert your computer into an Internet-enabled marketing survey to even access the games you ""own"" (but that Steam controls).  Once upon a golden time, when you bought a game you could put the CD in your computer and simply play it, perhaps with an activation key.  But with Steam, you have to set up an entire account larded with nefarious third party vendors just to have a fighting chance of even downloading the games that are supposedly just included in the Orange Box.  Fantastic.

And guess what - there is no mention of Steam anywhere in The Orange Box.  NONE.  The entire instruction manual for the Orange Box consists of a single two-sided set of control instructions for the actual games.  I guess they just forgot to print the ""Oh, By the Way, You Need Officially Licensed Steam Spyware To Install or Play Any Of These Games, Suckers"" liner.

I have never been more disgusted and embarrassed by a purchase before, and I've been to Amsterdam.  I strongly encourage everyone to give deep and abiding thought to whether they really want to pay $40+ a pop for the privilege of having customized spyware run roughshod over their computer.

The controls are so haphazard that it's not even funny.  Quite a few one-star reviewers mention this fact, and I'm proud to be among them. This game was NOT made to be played on the Nintendo 3DS.

Let's start with the analog stick.  Compared to the N64's analog stick, the 3DS's just plain sucks.  The slightly depressed center provides no traction whatsoever (unlike the concentric circles found on the N64's analog stick).  I'm positive that anyone reading this who has also played the original Super Mario 64 will agree that the controls on the N64 were far superior to the controls on the DS/3DS.

When you move Mario in this game, his running speed is not consistent.  Normally, Mario would either walk at a steady pace when you press Forward, or he would run when you press Forward and hold down a button.  In the DS version, the longer you hold down the Forward button, the faster he walks.  Why??  This was not the case in the N64 version!!!  Mario did not run faster the longer I held down the analog stick in the forward direction, so why does he do that here?  That's what Forward + Y button is for!  This control mechanism has slipped me up on numerous occasions and cost me countless lives unnecessarily.

And let's not even mention using the touch screen to move!  That's just instant death and should be avoided at all costs.  The game developers made no graphical improvements in this version either.  Some of the landscape blocks and other obstacles zoom right into the screen and get in your way at certain angles when you need to fight enemies or make crucial jumps.

Speaking of angles.....the CAMERA!  Oh, the camera.....forget that one, too.  You press the L button to center the camera in the direction Mario is facing, and oftentimes, it just keeps going around in circles.  Having to face Mario in the direction you want the camera to go in, and then attempting to move the camera with L, is frightening.

What made me quit a month ago:
1) Blizzard's ""I want you to play the way we want you to play"" attitude + mass nerfage.
2) Unrewarding loot.
3) Extremely repetitive farming. In D2, you could move between acts to farm various places in one game. Cannot do that in D3. If you're stuck in Inferno act 2, there is no option but to farm Inferno Act 1 repeatedly.
4) The game provides no incentive for cooperative game plays.
5) Impervious champion mobs with ridiculous affix combos. Unless you spend enormous amount of time farming or spend real money, you will be forced to play cat-and-mouse game.
6) The game developers have no idea what they've done wrong. Skyrocketing repair cost is a good example of a horrible deterrent for corpse cannons.

Skills do not work, feats do not work, AMD processors and ATI cards are left to rot, classes are wildly broken or imbalanced, It's a mess. All of the promising PvP features talked about? Nowhere to be found. They've clearly released a product that would is alpha state at best, and dug themselves consecutive years of patching just to catch up.

I would suggest as a long term genre fan to wait for Warhammer Online or Blizzard's next World of Warcraft expansion.

I was enjoying the original Fallout 3 game too much, but the down loadable contents(DLC) were too glitchy to try again.
Now with a new company making the new installment, I hoped that the quality of the game would be better.  NO IT DIDN'T.  It's basically Fallout 3 with additional glitches that are too much to enjoy.  What is worst is that the glitches are so bad that it CORRUPTS saves.  So forget about continuing your progress, since they won't mean anything.

If you still want to purchase the game, then DON'T PURCHASE THE GAME for this console.  The Xbox 360 has a timed exclusive like Fallout 3.  Also, once the DLCs were available for the PS3 users, the DLCs were filled with glitches that were NEVER PATCHED.

I REALLY HATE THE WAY BETHESDA SOFTWORKS AND their scapegoat, Obsidian Entertainment.  SERIOUSLY, THEY MUST THINK PATCHES ARE A GREAT WAY TO MAKE GAMES.  THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY FINISH THE GAME AND SEE THE QUALITY OF THE GAME IS GOOD ENOUGH TO PASS IT AS A FINISH GAME.

(Review of the game)
It's just one giant DLC.  Almost every part of the game is the same as Fallout 3.  The only differences are just the small details.  New additional weapons, trees, Vegas.  There are some good parts of the game, but there are just too much of the last game in this game that it's really not a new game.

It's much more harder than the last Fallout 3 game.  They went back to the original leveling up sequence from Fallout 1 and 2 where you can only get a perk after leveling up a few times, instead of leveling up every time.  Now you can get two more companions at the same time.  One is a living person and the other is a machine or mechanical one. Also, for Fallout 2 fans, this game does mention the tribal descendant, vault dweller as well as his/her's super mutant companion.  Arefu remind you of anything.

I rented this damn game, and, based on my experience, didn't taking advantage of Black Friday deals where this game was marked down to $34.99.  The game is just so badly made that I didn't want to help top this game as a best-seller.  As a PS3 owner, this time exclusives are worthless.  If you decided to stick it to your PS3 consumers, you can guarantee that some us are more interested in other games than your DLCs when it comes out.

Bethesda Softworks is a bad game company and their treatment towards PS3 consumers are horrible.

Puzzles are few and far between, and nearly all of them are simple inventory puzzles. As with the previous games, you just pick up anything the game will allow you to take, and tote it around, ridiculously, until you eventually have need of it. In a couple of cases the game even gives you detailed instructions for how to solve a puzzle. If you think that following instructions (complete with diagrams) is a lot of fun, well, this is the game for you.

Otherwise, you can just sit back and watch Poirot walk around. There is no way to fast-travel between locations, so much of your time will be spent walking. Hopefully you'll find that very entertaining, because the pace of this game is astonishingly slow. The game is composed of eight chapters, and the murder doesn't even occur until chapter five. Until then, most of the ""action"" comes from two new storylines created for the game: a Fifth Columnist hunt (the game takes place during WWII), and a plot about a glowing green ghost that even Scooby Doo would find silly. And don't even think about skipping any dialogue - if you don't painstakingly work your way through the dialogue tree, you're likely to get stuck.

But far and away, my biggest gripe with this game is the ""new ending."" Do not be fooled by this - the murderer is the same as in the novel!  Apparently the ""new"" part comes from the, um, action scene that follows (in cut scene, of course, because heaven forbid the player have to do anything during the climax of the game). The new ending doesn't even make much sense, really, but I was so happy to see the game end that I won't nitpick.

Bottom line: this game is a joyless, plodding exercise that never would have been made if not for the Christie name. Read the book instead.

Quick - check yourself - how many hands do you have?  Two?  Okay - then forget playing this game.

This game tries to use the face buttons, shoulder buttons, AND the touch screen all at once.  The D-pad and YXAB buttons do the same thing - left and right positions strafe, and top/bottom positions walk forwards or backwards.  The shoulder buttons shoot.  The touch screen - used with the stylus of course - controls rotation and angle.  Now, if you're right handed, this might feel a bit more natural - like using a mouse in an FPS game on a PC.  Meanwhile your left hand - while holding the DS of course - is used to move/strafe/shoot.  I'm left-handed, however, and this control scheme is unbearably awkward.  In addition, you use the touchscreen to reload, change weapons (which requires a touch-drag-release maneuver instead of a simple button click) AND to ""look down the sight"" of your weapon.  What THIS means is that in the heat of combat, you'll be removing your eyes from the top screen - which shows the action - to find your buttons on the bottom screen.  The ONLY good feature is that when using the stylus to aim/turn/angle, it ignores the other buttons, allowing you the full width of the screen to control your character.

The graphics - like pretty much any other DS game - are terrible.  Any NPC further away from you than (roughly) 15 yards is nearly indistinguishable from the surrounding scenery.  The only thing that helps you know you're pointing at someone is your aiming sights changing color.  Prefer to pick off targets from a distance?  Forget it.

This game is unplayable.  In fact, I've spent more time writing this review than I have playing the game - it's really that bad.  Sometimes you just have to accept that some games don't work on a handheld console.  Wonder why WoW isn't on DS?  Maybe for the same reasons that Call of duty SHOULDN'T be...

Worst of all the game does not seem to register movement consistently.  While I find Wii Fit to be spot on this game often did not register that I was moving even though I was working hard.

I had been reading about a Rogue Warrior game for years and when I saw the game was finally released and it was released through Bethesda works, I grabbed it fast. As soon as I found out it was a STEAM game, I refused to even install it (for about 2 weeks). I finally decided to install it because I read somewhere that you can install only a single player-offline version and that was ok with me. It is true. You can intall it with all the multiplayer software and have to register it through STEAM or you can install the offline version that does not require STEAM. LOOK! STEAM got something right!
I know, ""Was the game any good?"". Just trying to play through the first mission, I was sickened by the bugs and poor controls. While trying to inch my way to a corner by pressing the ""W"" key 1-2 times, the game would autorun my character out into the open getting me shot. Even though I wasn't pressing any buttons, it would randomly decide to ""stick"" that key ""active"". For example: Strafing left I would let go of the ""A"" key wanting to stop near cover, only to have my character continue to run left getting me shot yet again.
Also, it had problems recognizing I even pressed keys sometimes. I would press the ""N"" key 3 times before the game recognized I wanted to put my nightvision goggles on.
I switched keyboards and had the same problem. It's the game, not my hardware.
Graphics: Looked great but even though I lowered the spec's (textures, motion blur, etc) it still had a bad delay in trying to render the environment just from me looking around with my mouse. I have a 9800gt video card so I should not have these problems.
AI: Enemy AI is random as well. A guy will be 5 ft in front of you and not know you're there and then a guy all the way across a courtyard will open fire on you while you're crouched and concealed.
Many people are upset by the language in the game. I have to be the devils advocate here. With almost 20 yrs Military service, talk like this in a combat/deployed area is commonplace. Many Marines, Soldiers, Sailors and Airman do talk like this when in combat zones. The flipside is, no idiot (definately not a SEAL) is going to yell insults while in a covert mission as you see in this game. THAT was fake and was just simply overdone in this game.
All in all, the game LOOKS great but there is no way I will recomend it to ANYONE. I hope it is better on the consoles for the Xbox and PS3 players.",Bab bad and misleading,1260316800,7,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

1. Ammo is much less available, making some guns useless.
2. shield weakpoints are nonexistent and after shield is down, everyone (you or enemy) goes down easy, no matter where the target is hit.
3. movement is not as responsive as other halo games.

In my perspective if you're looking for the same feel that you have gotten from other halo games, you won't find it here. Its clear that it's not Bungie anymore and that 343 decided to drop in their brew into this game.

1.0,True,"11 2, 2016",AK884VX5S74ZW,B01GOK4FX2,MacGyver,"Let me begin by saying I'm a big hockey fan and have been regularly playing the NHL series for a very long time.  After delivering two poor releases for the latest gen consoles ('15 & '16), EA promised they were directing all of their efforts toward improving gameplay for '17.  They failed.  I honestly believe that from a gameplay standpoint, this game is actually WORSE than NHL '16.  The two modes I play the most are HUT and EASHL so I'll discuss gameplay issues and then touch on these two modes.

Gameplay is the heart and soul of any game and once again this is where NHL fails miserably.
-Faceoffs are impossible.  No matter what grip you use or how you time it, you will lose the draw 9 out of 10 times.
-Checking is a joke.  You can be skating directly at an opponent and without them even deking, you will skate directly past them like there is some sort of invisible force field between the two of you.
-Stick lifts will always result in a high sticking/hooking penalty, poke checks usually result in a tripping call.  I wouldn't mind this if the playing field was even but the opponent AI is able to use these tactics constantly and effectively without taking a penalty.
-Speaking of poke checks, they could rename the game to Poke Check '17 because that is pretty much the only thing you can attempt to do defensively.  The opponent AI will come at you with a nonstop barrage of poke checks.  If you try and protect the puck, they can simply bump into you, knock the puck off of your stick, and away they skate with the puck.  Conversely, if you bump a computer opponent, the puck is glued to their stick.  They will not lose it.
-Passing seems off, much worse than last year.  I'll aim a pass directly at a player and it will fly 10 ft in front of him and down for an icing.
-Player transitioning, a major issue in the previous two games, has NOT been corrected.  I still find myself having to switch players multiple times in order to get to the best positioned player.
-Your team mate AI is completely useless.  The opponent AI is constantly aggressive both defensively and offensively.  Just like in years past, your teammates act like they've never played hockey before.  Defenders make no effort to poke check, stick lift, knock a guy off of the puck, etc.  I've heard EA claim in the past that you shouldn't switch players often and that it draws teammates out of position.  Well, you're forced to because the AI makes no attempt to defend.  Offensively is the same.  Teammates will skate directly in front of you, make no effort to get open and just generally have no sense of offense at all.

Moving on to HUT.  I bought the Deluxe Edition because I started getting into this mode last year and really enjoyed it.  My biggest complaint was the difficulty in acquiring decent cards and your ability to earn coins.  Not surprisingly, both are just as bad or worse than in NHL '16.  Coin payouts are roughly the same as last year but HUT games seem longer.  There are no other options to earn coins other than playing games (or spending real money which I won't do) so be prepared to invest some time.  As of the time of this writing, over 6 weeks since release, I've yet to see a 2x coin weekend.  And as far as pack luck goes, nothing has changed.  Between '16 and '17, I have spent hundreds of thousands of coins on packs and have easily opened 100+ gold packs (plus several special packs) and I have never pulled a player higher than 86.

EASHL is the only mode that is somewhat fun in this game.  There is a lot of added depth this year in terms of customization options for individual players and clubs.  They still need an easier method of searching for clubs and recruiting players.  I was fortunate enough to find a club early on so i can't really review the improvements for drop-in players.

My final verdict - I spent over a month playing this game before finally throwing in the towel.  The gameplay is far more frustrating than it is fun.  I'll probably continue to log in once a week and claim my HUT pack since I already paid for it but that will be the extent of my playing time.  Unless this game receives major patches, this is yet another failed attempt and regression in a series that desperately needs help.",Another Massive Disappointment In The NHL Series,1478044800,17,"{'Edition:': ' Deluxe', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

She also purchased the Dual Shock controller for me as well, being that that model did not come with it. She then also purchased a 2.5"" 5400RPM 80GB hard drive to replace the smaller 40GB Hard drive in the PS3.

So I was taken advantage of by selling the older model for the newer model price and making me pay 109.98 extra for the upgrades.

Empire: Total War is to Medieval II: Total War as Windows Vista is to Windows XP. I am someone who owned Medieval II: Total War, the immediate predecessor to this game, so I can make that statement. Here's what happened. I have a (still) powerful computer, one that has always played games to their full potential. I would play Medieval II with the graphics all the way up and see beautiful animations and a very nice campaign map. While I knew that I would likely not be able to play Empire: Total War at the max settings, my computer still greatly exceeded the requirements on the box, and I therefore expected that, even though I wouldn't be able to play at max settings I should still see a level of graphics somewhat comparable to Medieval II.

Boy was I ever wrong. What I saw on the main battle map looked like Age of Empires 1. I kid you not, it was that bad. I went into the video settings, and it refused to let me even try a level higher than ""medium"", and medium looks as bad as Age of Empires 1. Or the original Civilization. I didn't even bother to go into a battle, because I couldn't imagine how bad the actual war animations would look.

This has to be the most inefficient, poorly coded game around if a fast, 64 bit, dual core machine with three gigs of RAM (in dual channel mode), a 10,000 RPM hard drive and a fast, powerful PCI Express video card cannot achieve a graphical level better than Age of Empires 1. Perhaps I was wrong in using the XP to Vista analogy... Vista was dog slow at first, and did eat system resources alive, but at least it did look a little better. This game, on the other hand, cannot even produce graphics 1/5 as good as its predecessor did on the same hardware, and is as ugly as can be. And thanks to the Steam DRM, I can't resell it, and since I opened it, I can't return it. I'm now stuck with a game I do not want to play, and probably won't ever play since I don't have 3,000 dollars right now to buy a Core i7 machine (which is what they advertise in the opening splash screen).

For one thing, the computer AI got increasingly more difficult.  Not that this is a bad thing, but the game has a fatal flaw to it.  Even when the difficulty is set to EASY, and you decrease all the AI Reversals to MINIMUM, the computer is STILL too difficult, and you can't achieve the historical objectives.  In later matches, the computer opponents reverse like crazy!  WHY is this happening when the options have been tweaked to the easiest of settings?  Illogical.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this is a deliberate attempt on behalf of the developers to get more money out of the public.  How?  With the Accelerator Pack DLC for $1.99 that unlocks everything in the game.  You can't unlock everything and get all of the superstars (except for one) without completing the 30 Years of Wrestlemania mode.  2K and Yukes are making it clear that you have to pay an extra $2 to do that.

And this was on ""normal"" difficulty mode. I assume on ""hardcore"" mode, it's possible to lose half of your health, at most, but then watch it regenerate back up again - wow, how realistic and how challenging is that?

Driving looks and feels absolutely horrible. Cars are big and bulky with loose, unrealistic handling. When you hit any object with your car, whether it's another car, tree or pole, you simply bounce off like a pinball and just keep on going.

No secondary camera angles. While on foot or in a car, you can not zoom out to see more of the world, leaving you with just one camera angle with a close and intimate look at the atrocious graphics, considering an October 2008 release for the 360 console.

 SR2 is a poorly made game and the makers should be ashamed to release it in late 2008 and compare it to or compete with the quality and the realistic feel of GTA IV, which is not perfect, of course, but it is still the best. The open-world sandbox genre will always belong to GTA. Yes, SR2 has many features and customization options but what is the point when the game looks and feels so terrible?

Hailed as being an ""extreme"" RPG, I thought a little challenge could be fun (just got done played a series of fun, but easy games.)  Plus, it was cheap.

This RPG game is only ""extreme"" in how bad it is...  The difficulty in this game comes from a completely random, roulette wheel battle style, and the fact that every challenge in the game require level 30+ skills to overcome, when you're at level 2.  Seriously, you will encounter a barrel, a door, or a treasure chest and not be able to do anything, right at the beginning of the game.  You later find out it takes a level 30 skill to break or open anything.

So, you walk around what is basically a board game playing field, moving a stationary character drawing one space at a time, while random pictures flash in the background.  Occasionally you get in a random battle, which is where the roulette attack wheel comes in.  All your skills are put on a fast spinning wheel, and what you land on is what you do.

Or, you encounter a trap.  If this happens, you use the same wheel to try and avoid it, which it early levels, is something like a 1/19 odds.

The battles present another huge problem.  You have your standard HP, and you have LP.  LP is your life points, and if a character is attacked while in KO (after HP reaches 0, typically) you lose an LP, and when LP is gone, you're dead for real.  You get shocking little LP... like 2 or 3 at most... which wouldn't be too much of a problem except tiny monsters in random battles do LP damage while you still have full HP!  So, at full HP, a 2 hit kill monster can hit you for an unavoidable 2 LP... possibly killing a character.  This makes HP completely useless...

I never found an item that could cure LP, either.

There are multiple characters you can play, with different storylines.  A good feature, but the stories (played out through a very few still picture/word sequences) were bland and confused, and none of them sparked my interest enough to possibly warrent played through such an unfun wreck of a game.

Not even worth the incredibly cheap price and shipping.  Stay away.

This game is a waste of time. It looks great, but just isn't playable.

The AI isn't capable enough to handle combat...at all. Your party members just walk into the enemy, swing, and die. Blocking is very effective...but your AI party members never do it. You spend over half the time in combat stopping to bring up the menu to heal or revive your allies.

I died three times in the second area of the game as well. Dispersed among the levels are absolutely terrible monsters that will can easily kill your party. The treasure chests attack you. And they annihilate you. They're by far the most difficult enemy in an RPG's early game that I've seen. One hit from them takes off most a character's HP, it can hit multiple characters, and can sometimes attack more than once per animation. The game also scales them up in levels to always be vastly stronger than you, and to top it all off, the game explicitly prevents you from running away from them (the run menu is greyed out when they attack you...) This is completely against the general exploration theme of RPG's...you're supposed to find and open treasure chests, not wonder if the chest contains an item or a practically guaranteed Game Over.

The game also froze once when I was playing it. Interestingly enough, it was when I opened a treasure box...the screen flickered, and just stopped.

Now remove everything that was great about it, add a portentous and dull reading of American history, bad acting, a 10 hour escort mission, and about five thousand trashcans. That's Bioshock Infinite.

I have to admit with frustration that I didn't bother finishing it, despite the money I spent on it. Life is too short and I have GTAV waiting, so I quit after about 6 hours of looting trashcans. I hate quitting games I've started, I always really feel like I have to see it through to the end. But this one took the biscuit.

The game is a drag. It almost never, ever comes together. I was excited exactly once, when I first flew up to Columbia. The first sky hook mission was pretty cool. But everything else? A sorry, empty, atmosphere-less drag. This huge city in the sky? It's empty. No-one's in it. Except the people who want to shoot you. And they're boring.

The game has zero tension, zero suspense, zero atmosphere, zero emotion - believe me, just zero. All those other people who say how great the game is? I'm telling you, they were smoking crack when they played it.

The story telling in this game is pathetically poor. I had been playing for a few hours, when I decided to consult an online walkthrough and discovered that my character had been a detective before going up to Columbia. WHAT? I had no idea! That would explain those annoying black and white flashbacks that pop up occasionally and make no sense

Most soap operas are constructed better and have more believable characters. Booker De Witt? One-note tough-guy dork with furrowed brow. EXACTLY the guy on the cover, by the way.

What about the actual gameplay - the action? The weapons feel generic, and it matters barely a squat what you shoot with, as the enemy AI is so poor that you're basically herding bulletsponges. It bored me senseless. Anyone playing this game for the action is either a masochist or, again, smoking crack.

Apart from spending my time shooting, what else did I do?

What I mainly did in Bioshock Infinite was loot trashcans. Because that's pretty much all there is to do in this amazing alternate reality they cooked up for 150 million bucks. Trashcans that contain food (sometimes), ammo (usually), and coins. There are lots of wooden boxes to search too. And lunch boxes. But mainly trashcans.

If you want a great game about saving a woman, get Dishonoured. That's got some great atmosphere, some great moves out of the first Bioshock playbook, and very compelling gameplay.

It may be some sort of bug, but the problem lies in the directional pads not being reset back to a 0 counter. This means that the directions get stuck (namely the right and down). The function of the controllers have been tested (I tried 4 SNES controllers that are constantly used on my SNES console) and they appear to work fine on Windows 7 ultimate (no other installs to test);

I read from a previous reviewer that they was having the same issue. On a whim I attempted a few controller apps (ControllerMate and USB Overdrive) both of which detected the controller just fine, but alas, had the same problem. I can show an output file if needed from ControllerMate.

basically what happens when you push a direction on a controller button is simple math. +1 or -1 is added to 0. Normally the controller resets to 0 automatically when you do not press anything. unfortunately, the number instead stays at +1 for both X and Y axis (which happens to be right and down, respectively.)

Overall the design of the product is not bad, the chord is very hard plastic, and the plastic they used for the housing seems to be close to the SNES plastic.

Many (truly) folks, including me, can't even play the game because there is a limit to the number of characters, and this bug prevents you from switching characters in your group. For example, I tried to play a multiplayer party mode in which the limit was 3 characters. One early quest requires you to make a dwarf a member of your group. When you need to get your original party members back, the only way to do that is to release this dwarf to the Inn. When you do that, the game quits and when you start again, that character is gone from the game. There are many other problems related to this bug.

I would normally expect a patch to resolve this problem from the developers, but apparently the thinking is that this won't happen unless you import corrupted save files.

First off, the interface is clunky as all get up.  I could not figure out how to get to what I was trying to click on.  For the Crunchroll app (one of the few video streaming apps that is supported, more on that later) I had to use the arrow on the remote control (not included, and a useful accessory) to get to the search button.  The arrow is a button that does not look like a button on that controller.  You make the cursor go away by pushing any other button.  The shift is like the shift on a keyboard, not a phone. You need to hold it down to get a capital letter.  With a Lego Yoda game, I could find no way to click on the choice between dark and light side.  Some of the games work, but it's hit or miss.

I set the system default language to English, so the games kept defaulting to French. For the farming game that comes with it, I could not see how to swap it before the tutorial began.

I am using an Ethernet connection so the system keeps saying it won't download until I connect to WiFi (clearly it checks for WiFi and then assumes I'm on a cellular plan).  This gets annoying.

The main feature is its ability to stream GameFly games, but the game lists are paltry.  The plans are by genre, so if you want say family games and action games, you need two subscriptions.  Not that there is much to recommend any of the packages.  Most have few games, and only one or two popular ones per subscription.

Forget streaming video.  Crunchyroll, Crackle, and HBO Go were supported, and YouTube of course, but no Hulu, no Vudu, no Netflix, no Amazon Video.  The pickings are sparse. Crunchyroll did not stream cleanly, but rather had an odd border around the video.

That leaves the ability to stream pc games to the device, in the odd situation that your PC does not have an HDMI port (a splitter will let you put out to TV and monitor both).  I found that of dubious value since my PC already goes to the TV at need.

  I'm sorry, (well I'm really not) Starcraft 2 is a great game, but blizzard just doesn't want to listen to their fan base any more. Here are their shortfalls
  1. NO LAN. Really? Are you kidding? Does blizzard not sit down and play their own games anymore? Lan is what made the original starcraft HUGE. It's ridiculous to think that I can be in the same room with 8 other people and not have a functional game because all of our data has to be sent accross the country and back. We're in the same room, why can't we just be able to really play in the same room. 8 people playing starcraft can really eat into your bandwith. If you don't have the top of the line internet, you may be out of luck for your 4v4 games. That's not even considering if you have other people beyond those 8 on the network. Recently at a professional tournament (march of 2011), One of the people lost connection to the game. I watched this game it was pretty intense and very close to the end. They had to reschedule a rematch! Imagine that. If blizzard had just listened to their customers this wouldn't be a problem. So you might ask, ""it's just a game why not just reconnect and play another round?"". I agree because I'm a casual gamer, so if I lose connection I'll be mad, but life will go on. However for this tournament there was a couple hundred grand ($xxx,xxx) on the line. I can only imagine how much the participants wanted to throttle someone over at blizzard. Blizzard listen up. I know you're not deaf. Steam has a play offline mode. Sure blizzard isn't steam, but last I checked playing offline isn't copyrighted. GIVE ME LAN!!!!
  2. HAVE TO CONSTANTLY BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET TO PLAY. I don't know their exact reason to do this to all of us. I don't have a cause or reason to blame, but if I were to point a finger at anyone, it would be Activision. Blizzard is huge enough and has enough of a fan base without a 2nd publisher interfering. Joining them simply doesn't make sense. Perhaps if it does maybe that's why they may be out for money instead of listen to their customers. (cough) no lan. Microsoft has the same problem as blizzard when is comes to pirating,but last I checked, despite Microsoft is demanding more money than they did for previous operating systems. They don't play babysitter and ask you to be connected to the internet at all times. I find that it's extremely disappointing that blizzard can't trust customers to be honest. Activation sure, no problem. I believe it helps us all be more honest, but why can't I play a single player game without the internet? I'm a big PC gamer and this whole movement to have to be connected online constantly when playing my games is ridiculous. It makes consoles appealing.
  All in all. other than these two major breaker-issues. I'd say you get a pretty good game.
  I honestly think we all have pirate bay and other pirate websites to blame for the issues we're facing. Honestly ask yourself if pirating wasn't an issue, would blizzard have any need to have every player log in and authenticate their copy EVERY TIME THE GET ON? EVERY TIME? lets not kid ourselves: When the community gets stolen from it hurts the community and those who steal -Even in the long run. People had been pirating games long before constant interent connections had to be made, but now they're fighting back and honest consumers are paying for it. Thanks guys.

PvP - Blizzard decided to release the game, then patch in PvP months later. There is still no PvP option, and so many people have stopped playing the game, there will be almost no one left to play the PvP. This is one of the big problems. TO be honest though, even PvP would not have kept me playing.

Auction House - I'd like to be able to be excited when I find good equipment to use in the game, but now even equipment is just a grind. You just buy something from the auction house every few levels, and never ever use the things you find. Now, it's not just the killing/leveling that is a grind, but gearing is too.

Whatever the reason, they could not have played this huge disaster of a game.

It hard locked my Xbox twice within two hours. Had to unplug the power cord to reset the Xbox. That's a big no-no. You don't wreck the core system like that with a crash, people. If the game had been even REMOTELY tested by QA people, this would have been a known issue.

Secondly, the character keeps getting stuck in the environment, like in a wall, or in the level-up ring in the Hero's Guild. There, after leveling up my abilities, my character stood frozen, unable to rotate or move. So, naturally, I loaded a recent save just outside the Guild. My character was naked and the game was seriously glitched at like 1 FPS, totally unplayable. I killed the game, re-ran it, and decided to give it one more try. I got as far as fighting the Hobbes on that farm. When I didn't beat the girl's score, the game wanted me to reload an old save to try again. Except, it hadn't bothered to DO a save before that began, so I was back to about 20 minutes in the past, running through the forest again to get to the farm.

Searched for workarounds. Cleared the HD cache on my 360. Let it sit on the title screen for a while as suggested. And you know what? After that, after the hard crashes and getting stuck in the game level, I'd had enough. Deleted off my HD.

On default max settings it's really bright, colorful, and almost nauseating. I suppose I could have tweaked it down, but that would have bugged my friend.

I haven't bought it myself because of the DRM. For EA games alone's use of this DRM there are four class action lawsuits filed. This doesn't include other companies' usage. It takes a whole lot to get a class action started, so instead of just senselessly ranting I'll tell you what the DRM does, and how it effects you. I'll leave the technology stuff to other people and google.

What the DRM does:
You have five activations, much like microsoft's activations. After that you must call in and ask for another one, unless you specifically uninstalled the game. Doing so gives you a refund credit.

The big beef with this is that it requires online activation on install, and most people, when they have to reinstall a game, are doing so because of a reformat or because the game's install is messed up.

The second huge problem with it is that the pirates, the people who steal the software, broke this DRM off like a jedi with a lightsaber chops through a door. It was nearly effortless for the pirates-who the DRM is supposed to stop-to get through it.

So while the thieves prosper, and actually download this game and have it cracked in less time than it takes to run to the store, we have to pay for the game and deal with the DRM, or go into a legal gray area and crack our own bought software.

If we crack it ourselves, we lose out on legitimate multiplayer because the online servers don't let cracked copies on. The pirates play amongst themselves and thusly have no penalty. Their games even run faster than ours because the DRM is off of them. (Though it is only slightly faster)

So, while you may not have any trouble with the DRM for even a year or so after you get the game, you'll eventually have to call in. And if you're like me and an avid gamer, it'll be about eight games at once that want you to call in.

The controls were sloppy and counter-intuitive, in my opinion; I'm basing that off other 3rd-person games that had much more responsive and easy-to-use control schemes (Arkham Asylum or Just Cause, for example).  It's not at all clear, even early in the easier parts of the game, what buttons or combination of buttons to use to accomplish a task; sometimes using items or powers requires control actions that are not shown at all.  I'm sure it can be figured out, but controls should be something simple to pick up and easy to use, not something that becomes a challenge itself.

The camera was out of control and felt like someone with a nervous disorder was filming the game; it moved way too much and the angles were poor, at best.  I'm sure you can deal with it and play the game, but it got in the way for me and I don't want the perspective to distract from the gameplay--that's a basic requirement.

The story was disjointed and non-sensical.  It reminded of some of the obscure japanimation movies where strange things happen all around you and there's no explanation or no logical connection to what you're doing.  A lot of players really enjoyed the ""story"" to Dark Souls, but even after reading blogs and reviews, I'm still scratching my head.  Compare this game to something like Arkham Asylum and you're left wondering if there's any narrative cohesion at all.

It's tough for me to call this a role-playing game.  I grew up playing a lot of RPGs, both on consoles and PC, and this has little in common with any RPG--even table-top pen and paper gamers might struggle to unravel the convoluted RPG mechanics at work here.  Character progression, saving, stats, items, and so on are poorly organized and presented, making character management another challenge that distracts from gameplay.

If you loved this game, I'm glad for you--truly--but I'd be very wary of picking this one up based on reviews.  It's not going to be for everyone and I suspect it'll be a love/hate thing for most gamers.  I enjoy games where the controls, camera, and character progression are simple to use and don't get in the way of the game (Skyrim, for example); if you feel the same, be careful with Dark Souls.  I also require some cohesion and logical progression to the story which is absent here; if you're looking for a good story that makes sense and connects with the player's actions, you may want to stay away from this game.",Not a game for everyone,1357516800,18,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Here were some of my biggest issues with the system (and by that I mean the console, Microsoft, and gaming companies):

1. I'm required to be on the Internet.
So basically I have to buy the system and have internet for it to even work. The original I could play even if the internet went down, now not so much.

2. Required to have Xbox Live.
Now this isn't a requirement for all games but a lot being manufactured these days require you to have Xbox Live to do anything more than the tutorials. Xbox Live $60 a year plus, $60 for a games = $120 to really get anything out of it.

3. Updates and game installation.
Seemed like any time I turned the system for the first week I would wait 15min for the it to update. On top of that I had to install the game on my system which took around 30 min. Plus once the game was installed and I find out I didn't like it, sorry no returns since the games can only be installed once.

I don't know if it's me not catching up with the times but it seems like games and consoles have gotten way over priced and you can share games like we used to. On top of that we have to now pay a membership fee to even use the games we ALREADY BOUGHT. This all seems like one big marketing ploy to me.

But I ignored them, for I was so close to escaping.  My freedom awaited as I got closer and closer to the gates.

But there was only one barrier left...the devil himself.

""Hello there!"" he giggled as I finally reached the gate.  ""So, you want to leave?  Of course you can!  There's only one thing left you have to do!""

He reached behind his back and pulled out a copy of Dead Rising 2.

I froze, my heart skipping a beat as I gazed upon the case, terror threatening to overwhelm me.

""Oh please, not that!"" I said.

""If you want to escape Hell, all you have to do is play Dead Rising 2!"" the devil said.  ""Why, there's some fun stuff in here, isn't there?""

""Yes,"" I stammered, terrified.  ""I mean, the graphics are good, and it's amazing to see lots of zombies on screen on once...when I first ran through the streets, it was amazing to see all those undead monsters lurking around.""

""Anything else?""

""Yeah!  It's awesome to find survivors and guide them to safety.  It's so satisfying and fulfilling to save other people's lives.  It really made me feel like I was making a difference, and having to be creative in some of them was awesome, like the time I had to carry a woman in a mermaid costume to safety, or when I had to defend a war veteran who was crippled and couldn't walk very fast, or even better, when I found two soldiers fighting for their lives and had to try and lead them to safety.  These were arguably the best moments of the game, and the most fun.""

""That is indeed great,"" the devil said.  ""But tell me...why are you so afraid to look at it?  Is there something that you didn't like?  Like...oh...say...the boss bottles?""

""No!"" I shouted, falling back to the hard ground.

""Oh?  You don't like them?  After all, I designed them myself!  I thought they'd be fun!""

""They wern't fun!"" I yelled.  ""They were awful!  They were the worst boss fights I've ever endured!""

""Oh really?  How so?""

""They were too overpowered!  Bosses could take away half your health in a matter of seconds!  The game gave them all the advantages, and didn't give you any help!  They're so overpowered and so cheap, it's disgusting!  Like those two sluts in dresses and high heels!  They could run faster then I could, could take three times as much damage as I could, and had samurai swords!  I only had pipes to fight with, and they delt out so little damage where their swords could kill me in just a few hits!  It was atrocious!  Whoever designed these fights should be fired!""

""Sorry, not going to happen,"" the devil said, grinning.

""Then you're a horrible game designer!"" I shouted.  ""The main game is fun, but those boss battles are atrocious in every way possible!  They're so awful, that when I got to the last boss, I just gave up, uninstalled the game, and returned it to blockbuster.  I was so sick of dealing with cheap attacks and overpowered bosses who are enormously unfair!  If you had just toned them down, then the game would be great!""

At those words, the devil grinned even more, his teeth twisting into a demonic smile of pure malevolence, the likes that would make the most hardened sinner quake with fear.

""Well now, I'm glad you said that.  Because if you want to escape Hell, all you have to do is fight all the bosses at once, without dying once.""

He tossed me the game.

""Have fun.""

As he walked away, I stared at the case in my hand.  It was laughing, mocking me, it's voice composed of all the bosses taunting me, knowing that in a matter of moments, they would be killing me over and over, giving me next to no chance to fight back, and no hope of victory.

As blood poured from the case and began to drench me, I sobbed, even as I took the disk and popped it in the PS3, turning it on, even though there was no hope of escape.  Vultures came and pecked at my flesh and bones, hoping to tear me apart before I even got past the fat gimp with the chainsaw, for whom my hatred for was never ending, even as he knocked me off my feet again and again.

Plus, in order to know the story of this game, you have to read the direction book.  I can't remember it word by word, but it went something like this: ""Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth, when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of L.A."" Okay, so the story sounds good...but why wasn't there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story?  And plus, all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard.

1.0,True,"09 4, 2014",AK99N02LJ6YDT,B00DBRM3G8,Wild Rover,"I waited a long time to write a review for this game. I am a long time 2K fan, but what I really liked is when they started the my career mode. I have found a lot that I really don't like. Keep in mind I am only reviewing the my career section of the game.

Let me start with what everyone is complaining about. The VC! This game has turned into a money grabbing nightmare. Just the micro transactions alone ruin the game in my opinion. Sure you can earn it through play, but it takes a long time and you just don't make enough from game to game to make it worth it spending on anything besides player attributes.

Over emphasis on signature skills. This one is really agitating. I had an athletic center, 7th 2inchs, max vertical, and maxed out blocking and struggle to average 1 block a game. Add eraser and chase down artist and suddenly I was averaging 5.6 blocks a game. To me this is bs. They should place more emphasis on the players timing than making them use a ton of VC to get something that just makes their character react how he should in the first place being he's in the NBA. If this was high school basketball, okay cool.

That leads into a whole other problem. How terrible they start your career player at. You can't make a layup,  run down the court, dunk at 7ft 2in or pass, dribble or rebound. You are useless and belong at a grocery store, not on a basketball court. That coupled with the horrible attempt at a story line that also ruins the experience in and of itself. No words can express how miserable it is. You feel like you playing someone else's save with the stupid junk your player does and says.

Next we have position bias. Yes, if you are a center or a power forward,  you are automatically and are huge disadvantage. Both post positions are automatically cut out in the opening cut scene where your character is clearly a guard. Unfortunately that cut scene is what the rest of the game is like. Your 7ft 2 center will, post up for threes instead of roll to the basket on a pic and roll, spin layup, refuse to dunk under the basket. Miss post shots, but somehow knockdown jumpers? Furthermore, guards will out rebound you. My center was on the Timberwolves,  Rubio would out rebound me nearly every time we went head to head. This was also true with,  Tony Parker,  derrick rose, rajon rondo, jru holiday, and Daron Williams to name a few. In fact my center only averaged 6 rebounds a game! That's even with all the stats maxed out and all the signature skills for rebounding. So I made a 7ft small forward with the same signature skills as a test. Sure enough,  I know average 10 rebounds and 4 blocks (block stat maxed ar 75!) a game. I out rebound other centers and power forwards. This is really sad, being the small forwards rebound and block stats max out way lower than the centers do. It's obvious this game was made for people who wanted to be sf/sg/pg positions.

Lastly, the lack of actual basketball in the game. The AI for team mates is abysmal. There is no give and go, no pick and roll (your player actually freezes until the defender gets back on you), they never allyoop you or get you shots you can actually take. They throw you the ball and you are on your own. No one makes cuts, no one sets picks. It's obviously set up for someone to waltz down the lane and make lay up, or even more likely,  launch 3s.

With two factors that alone make this a one star, the VC/Micro transactions and the horrible attempt at a story line make this such a let down.

Yep, all of those games are great, but this one game is the reason that there aren't new Naruto Wii games out. This game took everything Clash of Ninja built up (decent gameplay even though it's repetitive as crap, real story lines taken from the manga itself[excluding Clash of Ninja Rev. 2, that game didn't suck], and actual attacking), took a blowtorch and ten gallons of gasoline and lit the series on fire.
For more of an in depth talk of what I mean, in the game that came before this, there was about 40 characters to choose from; Dragon Blade Chronicles has about ten from what I can remember (maybe less, I just sold the game because the only thing this garbage is good for is collecting dust). That was a huge disappointment because the game looked pretty cool. Also, the fighting mechanism is dumbed down so hard I feel like someone who has a mental handicap (I'm not trying to be insulting, I've been told I have really bad metaphors and  comparisons) complained that it was too hard. Instead of waving the Wii Remote around like every other game, you press A. That's it, just A, there are no other moves you can use but A and your jutsu. Which brings me to another thing, imagine the jutsu from the previous games, shot in the face with a 9mm bullet filled with half as much gunpowder the bullet doesn't go all the way through your brain, so you survive it. You're still there, but you can't do very much; that's the jutsu, it a jutsu that's sort of cool, but it they just took everything from the previous game and ported it into the new game with re done textures and a different storyline than the ported game, this game would have kicked some major butt. Every dark cloud has a silver lining, the storyline was pretty cool, I just watched the thing on YouTube, I couldn't play the game. I refused to subject myself to something as bad as this game, do yourself a favor and but Naruto Shippuden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3, cause that game in fact doesn't suck.

So I wrote a long review of this game, but came back to edit after playing 25 games.  It kills me to say this, but this game sucks.  There is a comeback engine in the game that is maddening, frustrating, and makes the game little to no fun to play.  Basically, if you score, plan on the opponent scoring as well.  I've had games up 5-0, 4-0, and 3-0 going into the third, invariably the opponent will go into ""God Mode"" and become unstoppable.  I've had opponents do the following:
1. Skate through 4 defensemen, score over the goalie's pad even with the goalie having the angle
2. Take a terrible shot, the kind you don't even take in hope of rebound, that the goalie doesn't see until the last second, despite a lack of a screen
3.  Get poke checked only to do a 180 degree turn from the waist to grab the puck and take a shot that goes in from the high slot, again with no screen
4.  Dump the puck from the rear blueline on the PK, only to bounce on net and become too hot to handle for my goalie
5.  The piece de resistance; a poke check from a tied up face off that sneaks five hole despite being slow enough for my grandmother to handle

Every time these improbable things happen, and they happen with regularity, I am winning.  Mind you, none of these things happen if the game is scoreless, or you are losing, only if you are up.  It has gotten to the point where my wife said ""you don't even celebrate scoring goals any more"" and I don't because they will score to match you and keep it close.  I went into the season stats to find data to prove this, and it is there.  My goalie is leading the league in wins, but is 55th in Save Percentage and 49th in Goals Against Average.  The only reason this can be possible is because they always match me nearly goal for goal.

I should have known better after buying Madden 12.  Thing is NHL 12 was so fun, I played that game like it was going out of style, and while goalies would let in the occasional softy in NHL 12, they are Patrick Roy compared to the goalies in NHL 14.  It's almost ironic that they chose a goalie for the cover of this years game because your goalie will suck in this game, no matter how well you play.  I even set my strategy to play more defensive, kept everyone back and only tried to score off the breakout, didn't matter, still gave up 4 (because I scored 4) and lost in a shootout.  If you score, you have to play like you have an empty net behind you.

Ok, I dealt with that and I destroyed all 3(or 4) meat sacks and the boss fell on the floor. The next step, you have to hit his hands so he will collapse and you will hit his head and kill him. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT. I couldn't target his hands, I was walking THROUGH his hands, he could hit me but I couldn't harm him. I was swinging the axe into the air and COULD NOT HIT THE BOSS OR HIS HANDS. After about 10 attempts, youtube and walkthrough checks, I rage quit and I threw the game away.

Too bad, I liked watching the game on youtube, but not play it. That's why I'm giving it 1 star, for being unable to play it.",One does not simply play Silent Hill Homecoming,1327536000,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

Through no fault of their own, Amazon provided me with two registration keys that were already used by pirates. Who gave those keys to Amazon? Electronic Arts.

During installation, the game needs a key. After installation, the game tries to tie that key to an EA or Spore account. I tried to register the game with the first key and it said the key was invalid. I contacted Amazon, and they issued me the second key. It was also invalid. When I contacted EA, they told me to login using the email address used to register the keys. The problem was, I hadn't registered it yet, and the email addresses were not mine. EA was not helpful at all.

Instead of requesting more keys, I asked for a resolution from Amazon. They resolved the issue to my satisfaction.

An extremely slow game that took me hours to make any headway.

Age of Empires III, rather than acting as a sequel to Age of Empires II, acts as a sequel to Age of Mythology.  The engine is pretty much exactly the same.  Perhaps thinking the ancients too stupid to build big buildings, all the buildings here are maybe 3 or 4 times the size of buildings in Age of Mythology, making the map seem very small and difficult to navigate as you seem to run out of space quickly.  Even ships look cartoonish simply by how massive they are in comparison to the puddle-sized river you've just built them into.

About the best improvements made from Age of Mythology is the population... you can have more than a 50 man army at one time here.

There is nothing else revolutionary here... it's the same old s-word with regards to real time strategy---civilians dig gold, hunt animals or farm, cut wood, build houses, build barracks, build church or mosque or temple, build infantry, mass them, attack, upgrade, build another base somewhere else, repeat.  The graphics look great, but they are highly unimpressive in battle... gunfire, cannon shots, explosions, are all unremarkable.  The only positive aspect I can say here is that the buildings actually look like they're taking damage when under fire---losing roof tiles, chunks of concrete and masonry crumbling off.

Everything else is just ordinary.  The sort of generic, unremarkable RTS of the next 3D generation, improving where Age of Mythology fumbled (that is, army battles), but breaking no new ground.

(Native Americans) Indians: They have some settlements littered around.  You build a trading post next to them and you can train some of their soldiers.  Mercenaries.  The good thing is they don't count towards your population.  Also you get a few upgrades that only give you a minor edge in battle.

In-depth Cities: Useless.  It does nothing.  You can't do anything with the cities.  Instead you get bonus cards, which give you little tiny gifts that don't turn the tide of the battle massively unless you've got nothing left.

So when this got out, I did not wait for the reviews, I went and got it and played three games end to end within the first month. Unhappy with it, I gave it a break. Tried it again when Revolutions came out and Again with Gods and Kings.

Then I thought , maybe I am doing something wrong so I went and read some reviews. I don't know what game the professional reviewers were playing - perhaps they played 5 minutes of it only? - because it was not the game I bought off the shelves.

*This incarnation is by far the most boring of them all and subsequent add-ons have done nothing to remedy the capital issues that plague it.*

So
* the good: better graphics, convincing diplomacy, tech tree with actual meaning
* the not so good : turns take a long a$$ time, everything takes a long a$$ time to build
* the terrible: abysmal representation of war, an integral part of human civilization

Some head honcho at 2KGames or Firaxis wanted , I imagine to make a statement about ""War! Huh!What is it good for?Absolutely nothing!""  as the song goes and they made it economically suicidal to wage war. Consider:

* in the early game, it takes about 500 years (!) to build a troop of spearmen. Should you choose to do it, it will block your city for that long so you will lose the critical early expansion phase. it will also take 1/4th or 1/6th of your precious population further setting you back. Consequently no one does it and antiquity is a time of peace with no whirlwind of chariots or clash of legions. So in Sid's world, city states go bankrupt or depopulated after they've raised a warband of spearmen.

* should you still persist in being a warmonger, Sid will punish you further. The game is so heavily tipped in favor of defense that a small city of  four (thousand?) with no defenders  (so presumably defended by the local militia, peasants and workers) and no fortifications will defeat (read: destroy)  an army of six (thousand) professional spearmen, archers and horsemen. You tell me, how is it even worth raising that army (spending the money,blocking your cities, e.t.c. see 1st point).

* should you by chance manage to conquer that city, you would think you population would rejoice in the loot , the glory and the newly acquired lands, slaves and markets. No so. In one of the most asinine showings of programming, Firaxis is calculating the happiness in your country as an average across all the cities you own, so conquering one tilts your happiness levels to red everywhere which immediately affects your build time, income and stability of your other cities. So much so you may never get out of that depression. So , let me get that straight: we just burned their temples, slain their warriors and took their women - and  that makes my whole country poor, angry and depressed? One unhappy city instantly turns the other 8 which were doing fine so far  - and they still do - unhappy as well?

* it costs a lot to maintain an army. Even in the modern age , with super metropolises, modern banking and a booming economy I could not afford an army required to take out a competitor. As soon as you conquer a city, that unhappiness kicks in, and if you dare take the second, that's going to bring you down. So you have to conquer a city, wait for 4-5 years to digest it, then one more, and then one more and so on. This is not how modern wars are being waged.

I had a lot of patience with this game, and I really wanted to like it. But it's plain boring.

They just won't because it would ruin them.

Good:
The graphics are awesome.
Sometimes combat is fun.
The OWL is cool.

Bad:
The campaign is extremely boring and frustrating.
The writing is terrible, nothing makes you care about the character or the world you are playing in.
There are two factions the Hellenic's and the Crustaceans or something... pretty much red eye humans and normal eye humans.
You spend A LOT of time watching cutscenes and cool stuff happening that you have no control over... it's almost as if they forgot that people play games because they want an interactive experience.
The combat music makes your ears bleed.

Modern Warfare 3 is unbelievably disappointing for a franchise which used to be the leader in innovation for the FPS genre.

Yes the graphics, menus, sound effects, and just about everything else are identical to Modern Warfare 2. I can forgive the game to a certain extent for the recycling, but what I cannot accept is how bad the map design, respawns, and matchmaking system is. The maps are smaller than ever, circular mazes of narrow alleys littered with random junk and enemies respawning behind you. 80% of your deaths will be someone who respawned and shot you in your back. Apparently Infinity Ward learned nothing from the failure of the matchmaking system in Modern Warfare 2 as the exact same system is back in full force, and that once again means you cannot kick the many hackers, cheaters, racists, and flamers you will inevitably meet, this of course not counting the fact that you will often experience lag in games where you will shoot half your clip only to see in the killcam that you were standing like an idiot and only managing to fire off 2 bullets.

I eventually spent quite a bit of time on that game online however, once I found a cool server.  I then gave it up and spent quite a bit more time on WOW, but I find myself growing more and more mind numbingly bored with that game and decided to give NWN 2 a shot.  I was suspicious however, with the relatively terrible reviews etc. and didn't have too high of expectations when I took it out of the box about a week ago.

The good-
The single player is a vast improvement over the original.  Being able to control your henchmen in and of itself greatly improves the experience.  The graphics are a nice step up, and found myself not overly dismayed by them.  They are by no means on par with oblivion, however they are vastly superior to the original.  The added classes from the 3.5 rules seem interesting, and the character creation / leveling process is pretty much intact from the original.  The storyline is good so far, about 3/4 the way done I think with the first campaign.  Not anywhere near as good as either baldur's gate 2 or torment, or the fallout games - about on par with temple of elemental evil I guess - but it is a lot better than the single player story in NWN.

The bad-
Muliplayer.  I just cant get the thing to run at all.  Stutters all over, crashes, simply gave up on it.  Too bad too because I was really looking forward to checking out the game online.
For the single player, the pathfinding is horrible.  Even worse than the original.  So terribly frustrating when you consider they have had a lot of time to tweak this.  In addition, the targeting is frustrating when it jumps back and forth between conversation and combat, loosing who and what you have targeted to jump to your main character and then leaving you fumbling back to try to target what you had previously to continue the fight.  The inability to switch the leaders of your party is also garbage.  Thirdly there are bugs where combat begins and the game will not let your pause - for 10 or more seconds at times.  These are simple dynamics that you think they would have fixed in play testing, however with the multiplayer as horrendous as it is I guess they outsourced the play testing to the equivalent of nomadic tribesmen in Mongolia.

First, they are completely wireless. A Bluetooth dongle attaches securely to the controller where the headsets typically plug in. Problem #1: There is a button on the dongle that powers the Bluetooth and it was stupidly placed on the back side. So if you play in an inclined position and rest your controller in your lap, you are frequently treated with a painfully loud notification that you have just turned off Bluetooth and chat is no longer available. I deal with that several times a night.

Second is ""Chat Boost"". Chat Boost increases the chat volume just a notch above the game volume. So if the game volume is just right, chat boost makes it louder. Think about that. My game volume is just right, chat is louder. By definition chat is too loud. So what do you do? You turn down the chat volume. Unfortunately, when you turn down the volume to a comfortable level, the chat breaks up. That's right, it's still loud enough to hear but the chat cuts out. I've recorded my voice and played it back. If the volume is at a comfortable level, you hear about every third word. Turn up the volume on the same message and you hear every word, LOUDLY! Chat boost cannot be turned off.

Third, notifications are painfully loud and annoying. I've already mentioned the notification system for all those times you will accidentally turn off the Bluetooth dongle but there is also the low power beep that is very, very loud and very, very frequent.

The sad thing is that none of this is necessary. It would have been cheaper and easier for Turtle Beach to make the dongle without a power button. Sure, it drains the batteries and is a bit of a waste if you aren't using the chat feature but you can always remove the dongle if you want to save batteries or even use another controller. The painfully loud, frequently repeating low battery alert is also completely unnecessary. My wireless 360 controllers don't beep at me for several minutes before the batteries die. Why must this? It's distracting and annoying. Of course chat boost is the worst. Whoever thought it would be a good idea to dictate to us what the chat volumes should be was very wrong. Let me decide how loud the chat should be.

So, in summary. They sound good but they are annoying every time I use them. I wouldn't bu them at half the price.

First, and very unfortunately, this game is keyed to having the CD in your drive before it will launch. I thought this moronic style of copy protection was gone many years before this game came out, but evidently not. Especially when you must enter a LONG serial number when installing the game in the first place, you should not have to keep track of and insert CDs for the game to play.

Next, I found the interface to be unnecessarily convoluted, and not intuitive at all. Just the organization of the areas didn't make a lot of sense to me, with some of the buttons you need to use the most being small in size and squeezed inconveniently down into the lower left corner of the screen. Some buttons to interface with the game have tool-tips, others do not. Some seem to have tool-tips only part of the time. LOL

In the play of the game itself, there is indeed a lot of variety, eventually, in the types and functions of units. For example, you can build smugglers for assignment to planets to leech wealth. However, you sort of just have to know you can do that, because the interface for using the smuggler doesn't show up until after you have built one, selected him, and selected a target world.

As others have mentioned, the game is supposed to be suitable for grand strategic play, but it completely fails there. I've played enough small unit real time sims, so I bought this game after reading promo material concerning the ""galactic map"" strategic play. The automatic combat resolution algorithms are badly broken, meaning that if you want to make real progress, you still have to RTS all the battles. Also, a grand strategic play style cries out for turn based moves. If you happen to look up from this game for a few minutes of real world distraction ... days of game time pass.

Finally, I found the game to be, visually, very poorly presented. Even the very simple graphics presented on the galactic map appeared dull and clunky. Increasing the screen resolution in video options surprisingly didn't improve the visual presentation of the game one bit. It was also difficult to do, as unfortunately the dialog to change the screen resolution, on my system, caused the mouse to disappear until I minimized the game and then clicked to bring it back up!",Big Disappointment,1324771200,,,

So needless to say, I was very excited for a mario kart game that would allow me to showcase my skills online, and relive memories with old multiplayer comrades who have since moved to other parts of the country.

Imagine my surprise when I put the disc in and discovered that there was no multiplayer grand prix mode!  Working in tandem to unlock new classes, tracks, carts, and racers had always been one of my favorite parts of Mario Kart, and it was something that Double Dash did to perfection, allowing up to four people to get in on the challenge.

I had invited the friend whom I played through all of the double dash grand prixs with over to do it again on the Wii, so after we found this out it sort of killed the buzz... but whatever, we had always spent a lot more time on battles than grand prixs anyway.

We found surprise again when we couldn't do a free for all battle!  After messing around with some vs. races on motorcycles we decided to ditch this game, and spent the night on the SNES, and playing bob-omb blast on double dash.

The bulk of my issues with this game can be condensed to three items:

-Lack of options
-Lack of skill
-Lack of creativity

Double Dash was filled with options, you could combine characters in various ways to get certain unique items or racer attributes. You could choose the number of laps in vs. races, and take your choice of three unique battle styles.  In Mario Kart Wii the lack of options is mind numbing quite honestly.  It makes the game feel as though it was rushed to production.  Why can't I choose how many computer characters participate in a battle or vs. race?  Why isn't multi-player GP available?  Why are there only two battle modes, one of which is hell of lame?  Perhaps most annoying of all... WHY CAN'T I CHOOSE TO TURN THE STUPID RACER NAME TAGS THAT SUBMERGE HALF THE SCREEN OFF WHEN I PLAY ONLINE!?!?!

The lack of skill required in this game was evident from my first GP race.  Every other Mario Kart game did a good job of making item boxes scarce, and the occurence of items such as blue shells and lightning very infrequent (although there was an OPTION in double dash to change this).  There are several tracks on the Wii version that are nearly unplayable because of the volume of items.  With 12 players, and the stupid items like the thwomp and lightning cloud that don't really help anyone... it just isn't racing anymore when there is absolutely no value to your place in the first 90% of the race.  Coming back with items is one of the great joys of mario kart, I understand that (I still have fond memories of hitting the super ramp on Mario Circuit 2 with a mushroom to cut a corner and jump up two places to secure first over ten years ago), but there is something else going on entirely in tracks like the Luigi Circuit on the Wii (which might be one of the worst mario kart tracks ever), where every racer gets ripped to shreds on every lap because of the overwhelming volume of items.

This gripe could easily branch into things like how the power slide boost, for the first time ever, is not controlled by the player (and I'm not talking about the manual vs. auto drift), but simply by the length of time you hold the slide, and how they reverted to the ""hold and wait"" technique of blocking items that existed in Mario Kart 64, as opposed to timing a reverse release to block such as in Double Dash, and how the ""get a boost when you are right behind someone for awhile"" time has been cut down to almost nothing... but I think I have said enough on this.

The tracks and items in general though... where is the creativity?  I'm not expecting the wildly refreshing array of tracks we were greeted with in Mario Kart for the GBA, or the slew of new items that required poise and tact to make decent use of that showed up in Double Dash, but there is nothing new on the Wii version.  Let me re-phrase that; there are a couple of new things, but they are quickly beaten to death via recycling (soooooooooooo many figure 8's), or in cases such as the mega mushroom, little more than repeats of other items (in this case, the star).  The half pipe thing is new... but I don't really see the purpose when it is faster to not go up the ramp?  And the motorcycles... who cares/if the drift controls were the same as in double dash no one would choose them for the cheap wheelie boost?

Then there are the lazy re-hashes of the classic tracks.  Changing the placement of item boxes, and other key features of the tracks (such as making the walls solid in the ghost valley track, and removing the rock throwing natives on the N64 DK track)... I just don't see the point.  I mean, I know that most people probably don't have every Nintendo console (sans Virtual Boy) within 5 feet of eachother in their entertainment room so playing Ghost Valley 2 on SNES isn't really an option... but seriously.  Some of these re-hashed classic tracks aren't even worth playing in the form they are presented here.

There are a few nice features.  Toad's Factory, Grumble Volcano, and Koopa Cape are amazing tracks.  There are a lot of karts to choose from (although the differences, as I can tell so far, seem to be negligible... unlike the kart selection in Double Dash where the differences were quite obvious).  And it's not like the game is unplayable, quite the contrary, it can even be enjoyable for short periods of time. As part of the Mario Kart franchise though, I just expect more.

I honestly don't know why though, as every big franchise title aside from Mario Galaxy and Twilight Princess has been like this.  No options, dumbed down game play, terrible online game options and matching features, basically just leaving a ton of potential on the table and all of my expectations largely unfulfilled.

This is easily the worst Mario Kart game, and definitely the last Wii game I pre-order.

Oh, and the Wii Wheel... don't buy extras of these.  They aren't worth the hassle.  After struggling with getting my kart to power slide correctly through two grand prixs I dug out the cube controllers (ps - why is there no option to configure buttons how I want? Or... better question, why does the GCN controller layout not match that of GCN Mario Kart when the only new feature is wheelies, which could easily be added onto the unused c-stick or d-pad or... even better, onto the L trigger that items are incorrectly assigned to!?)",A ruined classic,1209945600,90,,

Her Interactive offers pre-teen girls the chance to use brainpower, not firepower, and to pick up various educational tidbits that tie into the games. The graphics and voicework have steadily improved from the very first Nancy Drew game Secrets Can Kill, but the last three games (Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, Danger By Design, and Creature of Kapu Cave) have seen some backsliding in tired puzzles, monotonous find-the-object and perform-the-task-to-get-the-needed-object, and the lack of suspense that made games like Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake and Message in a Haunted Mansion great.

Creature of Kapu Cave finds Nancy on an assignment in Hawaii, land of swaying palm trees, hula dancers, and pristine beaches....but you'll have to read travel brochures if you want to see any of those things. The ""beach"" in the game is pitifully small and doesn't allow for exploration beyond collecting seashells--and most of the time, you end up going back and forth to the beach to collect the same shell. Nancy is working as an intern for Quigley Kim, an aspiring entomologist. Nancy also investigates a mysterious genius with serious anger-management issues. But where is the mystery? The intrigue? The ""I'm being followed by something creepy"" moments?

One nice feature is the ability to switch between Nancy and the Hardy Boys by calling each other on your cell phone. Navigation is done via ""GPS."" Nice concept, but the animation quickly grew repetitive every time I needed to select another location.

Most of your time is spent in the jungle collecting frass. What is frass? To put it delicately...bug poop.  Yes, Nancy spends a frustrating amount of time collecting and analyzing bug poop. Frank and Joe Hardy are undercover, checking up on Big Island Mike and Pua Mapu. Mike runs Big Island Mike's Excursions, a sort of barter economy where you catch fish and make seashell necklaces to earn Big Island Bucks, which can then be traded in for souvenirs, fishing bait, and necklace supplies. Pua is an up-and-coming surf champ. Other than that, there is a noticeable lack of secondary characters and potential suspects.

The puzzles are the game's major weak point. Much of the game (at least half) feels like repetitive filler: making necklaces, collecting shells to make more necklaces, playing the annoying arcade game to win stuff to make more necklaces, and sitting around trying to catch fish. There were no ""fun"" puzzles: spending hours sorting through insect parts and bug poop does not count. There is also an optional arcade game, Wiki Tiki, which has the most annoying song ever heard in a video game. The game is based on Paper, Rock, Scissors, and is purely based on what the computer draws. Prizes include shark's teeth, which can be used in more expensive necklaces.

Also, there are very few locations to explore, and very restricted movement within those locations. The beach, for example, is about four or five clicks long. You're blocked from continuing down the beach by a fallen tree. This is Hawaii, so more beach to explore would have been nice. The jungle screens all looked the same. Similarly, Kapu Cave offered pretty scenery but little to explore or interact with.

Overall, the game felt...empty. The amount of mind-numbing, repetitive filler puzzles added nothing to the overall experience except frustration. The ending held no hint of mystery or a rewarding payoff. I can only hope that the next Nancy Drew title is a return to Her Interactive's glory days.

The Good:

+ Voice acting

+ Graphics

+ Music

The Bad:

- Length (very short)

- Weak puzzles (including at least one known bug)

2.0,False,"11 10, 2014",A1DER9ALIMLFBK,B0026EV5FW,NightshadeBlack,"This is my 25th review and completed adventure in the Nancy Drew series.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT:  Nancy Drew wins a five-day trip to the Bahamas' Dread Isle [isn't she always so lucky?!] and decides to bring her two best friends [Bess and Georgia] along for some fun-in-the-sun.  But, a kidnapping happens to Bess and the island is virtually deserted when ND arrives a day later than her friends. Where is Bess!? To find her, Nancy needs to piece together clues to a hidden treasure from an ancient fleet of ships 300 years prior.  I loved the fact I got to have my first tropical adventure! I always wanted to visit the Bahamas.

INITIAL SCORE: 90

CHARACTERS:

George Fayne: Funny to see her scrambling with the satellite phone the entire adventure. I like George and can see that she isn't as attractive as Nancy's other friend Bess [yes I'm a guy], but I respect her practical nature on life.

Bess Marvin: Compared to other adventure's I've seen her partake in, she seems REALLY short and a bit pudgy.  Interesting to see HER's evolution of these characters from a physical and emotional standpoint. I wish she was a bit more active in these adventures, but at least she provided excellent entertainment.

Johnny Rolle: Pretty harsh guy for being the only one on the island.  I didn't like the way he talked to Nancy and there is always a trade task obligation that he dreams up in order for Nancy to progress in her investigation. Pretty selfish dude.

Coucou: Another annoying bird HER has brought back?! I had enough of Loulou from Blackmoor Manor and now I had to deal with its relative?! Well, turns out this avian wasn't as irritating as its grandmother [Thank Goodness]

CUMUL SCORE: - 2 = 88

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:

The tropical music [timbales & synthesizers?] was unique to the adventure and made for a decent backdrop as you toured the island in that golf cart. The third person was a sound choice although it was the only area where graphics have suffered for HER.  pretty generic-looking action characters. The beach/ocean noises made everything seem authentic.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 88

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The golf cart water battery challenge really pushed me to the edge [which is a good thing for my intellect], but when you are asked to partake in a timed underwater sudoku puzzle that guarantees that you die a few times [even with a walkthrough I had only seconds to spare and no  pausing to think], that is where HER has dropped the ball. That was ridiculous. This game was puzzle-heavy [more than any other except Blackmoor Manor] and I had to stop and consider if I actually enjoyed myself. I DID with the vervet monkey colored jigsaw space press, but the throwing coconuts and the 100% luck spinner game was not well-received.
I can go on and on, but put simply: Intriguing puzzle setups regarding style, but I found it troubling at times that there wasn't enough help to get you started on tackling them.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 87

GENERAL IOTAS: I mean, George & Bess are boy-crazy initially in the series, but then they seem to serve a purpose of more value in the mid-games [helping Nancy], and then they regress in maturity the last few adventures I feel. Where is the consistency?  It is hard to gauge the progression of these best friends.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 86

ADVENTURE ENDING: The tie-in to an earlier ND adventure was a nice touch in theory, but I wasn't believing the execution of it.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 85

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me four days [10 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 53

My Strong Points: I solved 80% of the puzzles.

My Weak Points: I did not guess the culprit!!! I wasn't taking the leap of logic HER was offering as the finale, but I can't say that I couldn't have figured something similar out. Walkthroughs to get me through a couple puzzles in order to save me 5 hours was a wise investment at the cost of sleuthing integrity.

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 85 + 53/ 2 = 69 [ B - ]

BOTTOMLINE: This adventure isn't as awful as people are making it out to be as a stand-alone game, but when you compare it to the others in the series, it is one of the worst. Buy this game but play it as you are waiting for the latest game to be released for something to do.

Cons:
I'll only talk about 1 problem so this isn't a book of a review. A lot of the other problems in the game follow this same formula. During Legacy play, you practice things such as shooting, rebounding, post defense, etc to develope your players. This should have been fun, but 2K dropped the ball here. I have now tried the 3-point shot drill many times (maybe 40) and still haven't passed it once. That might be besides the fact, but there are good reasons it is so difficult and it isn't my skills. The camera pans in everytime you shoot so you cant see your player anymore. The player will also move (sometimes a lot) after they shoot and you will have to wait for the camera to pan back, wait for the rebounder to get you the ball back (takes 2-3 seconds, which is an eternity), set yourself- making sure you are in the circle they want you to shoot from, then you can shoot and hope you remain in the circle during your shot. This is a problem, folks. In shooting drills it is very important to 'flow' and how did 2K expect us to flow when there is so damn much going on at once before, during, and after each shot?? It kills the fun and makes the game more of a hassle than entertainment. The menus are frustrating as well. For instance, they make you hit ""OK"" sometimes when ""OK"" is the only option. ""EXIT"" is another one they like to make you take time to press. I hope you follow what I mean here. If you only have 1 option, why do they make you think about it? haha. Geez.

Pros:
The actual gameplay during games is great. Fun. The graphix aren't anything new, but good. There are plenty of teams and conferences to choose from so chances are your favorite team is in the game (go Xavier). Some of the other drills are fun, even if there are those few that will have you more angry than anything.

Bottomline, this game is great if you only focus on actually playing the actual games, but there is totally too much frustration going on that its hard to WANT to turn the game on in the first place. I would recommend trying EA's college basketball game first. I personally haven't played it yet, but this game by 2K isn't what you're probably looking for.

2.0,False,"01 7, 2016",A3ULPB81JD4OGA,B000CDZP0K,Kelly Groce,"Super Double Dragon 4 was the first game in the franchise to really take a step back gameplay wise.  The Double Dragon games were becoming obsolete by the time of its release.  Competing games such as Final Fight by Capcom and Streets of Rage by Sega were better overall games.  They both had bigger characters and better looking stages which made them more fun to play.

DD4 was released very early in the Super Nintendos lifespan probably to help launch the system.  But the game series lost a lot of its charm from the previous NES games.  DD4 still offered its classic kick, punch, grappling style of combat as Billy and Jimmy, but now there was an added power meter bar you could fill up to do super moves.  This was one of the first games to feature the super move meter.  Unfortunately the super moves a punch and the trademark spinkick were incredibly weak and pretty much useless while playing the game.  You cant do the hyper knee or spinkick at will like in DD2.  The real downside to the game is the enemy weapons.  If you get hit with a knife half your life bar is gone, if you get hit by an explosion your entire life bar is gone.  The enemies seem to take a lot of hits even for the easier opponents.  This was the first DD game I was truly disappointed with.

Overall when I think of Double Dragon I always have fond memories of the old arcade games and DD on the NES trying to beat the super hard stage 3.  I spend endless hours playing DD2 on the NES.  DD3 is considered the black sheep of the NES 3 but even it had its moments with cool bosses, different playable characters and a cool ending.  DD4 was the least fun DD game I have ever played.  The great music is there in some stages and totally missing in others, the play control is average, the bosses are bland and nothing to write home about.  The challenge is about average hard but not overly difficult.  Lots of cheap deaths from objects thrown at you.  There seemed to be a lot less platform jumping in this game than in the previous games..

The creators must have been in a big hurry to finish the game because all you see is a black screen with credits when you beat the game.  No congratulations, no cut scenes or victory clips of saving the hot babe Marion.  So there is not much replay value once you finish the game ' bummer.  I would not advise any of the fans to really bother with the game it is very mediocre at best.  If the developers would have taken a bit more time on the game it could have been great.  With the 6 button control for the SNES a lot of the buttons were never used for the game.

Alas I cannot really recommend it, I would give the game 2 stars it seems primitive now compared to todays games action adventure games.

Cons:
- From startup, I wanted to exit the game. There was no option to EXIT the GAME! I had to ctrl + alt + delete and end the program.

- Very repetitive. You do the same missions with the same moves every time.
- Altair is able to jump from roof to roof and jump hundreds of feet into a pile of hay but he cannot swim. You die if you fall into the water on the docks (towards the end).
- Horrible AI: I found the AI to be very unintelligent. There were some parts in the game where I would be able to steal right in front of the guards and they just let me by. On a different occasion, I would be fighting and killing guards and civilians would yell ""Guards, he's killed someone!""

I found myself in the first camp as I anticipated what I thought would be a badass entry in my favorite series of games.  With Nintendo promising a more intricate overworld filled with puzzles that seamlessly flowed into dungeons, my mind raced, believing that the era of easy Zeldas designed with kids in mind was over.  What I got instead was a 40 hour fetchquest.

I'll probably spoil some stuff so watch it.

Also, I got the version with the bundled controller.
The controller is nice, and not as fingerprint hungry as the others.

Enemies in General:
I'll be very blunt. There's about 4 enemies that you'll actually ""fight"" throughout the game. Bokoblins, Moblins, Stalfos, and Lizalfos.  They each come with different ""versions"" of themselves, basically reskinned and using a different weapon, for example the regular Lizalfos and the Dark Lizalfos. Regular ones shoot fire, Dark ones shoot ""cursed breath"" which induces the curse status, new to zelda, which leaves you unable to use weapons/items.  That's about it, aside from the bosses.  Combat is basically finding the obvious weakspot, hitting there, waiting for the enemy to move around aimlessly for a bit, opening the weakspot again, and striking again.  All other enemies are ohko.  But seriously, 70% of what you fight is just bokoblins, with moblins coming in around 7/8th's the way through the game. Every single Lizalfos I fought dropped a tail, and I have 12 of them. Not very many of those in comparison with the rest of the game.  There's beamos here and there, deku babas, and keese too.

Dungeons and Bosses:
The bosses are pretty fun. You fight Ghirahim three times throughout, the second fight being the most fun.  This fact makes it so that there are less bosses overall, however, as he is the boss of the first and sixth dungeon.  The fourth boss is very very fun, throwing attacks at you and continually getting back up to wreck you.  The fifth boss and fifth dungeon are probably the best in the game with the boss and the setting leading up to and during the fight being really great and immersive.  The boss is a giant Kraken thing with one eye. The dungeon is actually a ship, and once you finish the dungeon and prepare for the boss, it starts to rumble. Giant tentacles begin to tear through the entire ship, leading you back up to the deck.  As I said, this makes for a really cool moment that immerses you completely within the game.  The seventh (and final) dungeon has no boss battle.  The seventh dungeon is however one of the more difficult parts of the game, and it is very enjoyable.  The final boss is absolutely pathetic.

The first three dungeons were beyond easy.  Getting inside them was tougher than the actual dungeons.  And getting inside them was basically just, dowse, dowse, dowse, ok now you have gathered X amount of things you need in order to get inside the dungeon which was extremely annoying. Dowsing has you basically moving around your sword in first person mode trying to pinpoint the location of something. Dowsing was originally showcased as a replacement to the compass, but you can't dowse inside dungeons. This continues to a lesser extent later on, but basically instead of exploring the game makes you waste time doing this.  There is not much to explore anyways, since the areas are extremely linear, as is the whole game.

As an example, in the first area which is the woods, you have to find a bunch of Kikwis, which are the little tanooki looking creatures.  When you find them all, you go back to their boss which gives you the slingshot, which is required to enter the first dungeon.  Standard fare, but your first time doing this will undoubtedly take you longer than it should. It isn't as seamless as they said.  When they said that, I imagined the world suddenly takes you through an area and you find a chest with a key inside and you realize, woah, I'm in dungeon! I thought I was still just outside! Nope.

Controls and Items:
I found that in trying to strike quickly, the control would often flip out and do the wrong thing.  For example, if an enemy has an opening that calls for you to strike in a downward and to the right position, and you try to quickly do this motion, more than likely you won't be hitting it correctly, resulting in the enemy parrying or your attack bouncing off and then getting hit, as you leave yourself open.  This was with the actual control that game with the game, not a wii remote + attachment.  When done in a slow motion, it is accurate. So you have to wave gently in order to perform an attack. Doesn't really feel like I'm attacking something.  1:1? I don't think Nintendo knows what that means.  Additionally, it is laggy. It will not perform the movement the instant you do it unless you're moving slowly.  I tested this between 60Hz and 120Hz, and it was definitely worse on the 60Hz (obviously).

Flying and swimming are handled in the same manner, by holding the wii remote horizontally and adjusting direction by tilting and twisting.  Some may like this, some may not.  I enjoyed flying and swimming, but it became a bit cumbersome with the laggy response time.

The shield mechanic is pretty solid.  You use the nunchuk to throw up your shield to reflect attacks, which normally gives you the chance to counterattack.  If you fail to perform it correctly though, it takes a chunk out of your shield's ""life bar"" which eventually leads to it breaking.  The shield can be upgraded, but it is sort of pointless seeing as you get the chance to buy an improved shield every time you feel like upgrading it.

Your other items work pretty spot on, even allowing you to recenter the aim with a press of down on the D-PAD. They all felt good to use, even though they didn't get too much use aside from the beetle.  The Bow and Arrows are the last item you get making it a bit strange that you can't use them to fight much through out the game.  I hardly used anything but the sword as a fighting weapon where as in previous zelda games I'd use almost everything but the sword.  The items are more spread out as well.  Items that we saw like the digging mitts are only useable in specific areas and are not assigned to your item wheel, but instead an equipped item, like a tunic would have been equipped in Ocarina of Time.  Your shield and bottles and nonessential items are stored in a secondary item wheel.  This can be seen as useful or not.  This is just a matter of personal opinion as I'm sure not everyone liked the huge item wheel from Twilight Princess.  This secondary item wheel can only carry four items initially, and must be upgraded by buying more pouches from Beedle in a majorly escalating price point.  The bomb bag and arrow quiver cannot be upgraded, but instead you can buy additional bags or quivers which hold an extra 5 units a piece.  These must go in your secondary item wheel, which can dissuade you from wanting them in the first place.  The game never leaves you without a patch of bomb flowers if you need them or without arrows if you cut the grass.  This same mechanic applies to the ignored slingshot.

Plot:
The majority of the time, when you get to an interesting plot point, you have to begin another fetch quest.  The biggest of these is

SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS

the forging of the Master Sword.  This negative point can be attributed to simple fanboy nerdrage, but let's examine it anyways.  In prior Zelda games it is said that the Master Sword is a relic of the ancient Hylians, forged by sages as the blade of evil's bane.  In this game, it is originally called the Goddess Sword, that the goddess Hylia creates in an intricate plot to destroy the game's main villain who gets mentioned about once throughout the game until the very end.  Link has to, in a similar fashion to the also not very good Phantom Hourglass, gather 3 of something in order to turn the Goddess Sword into the Master Sword.  Once you do create it, you get an anti climatic ""MASTER LINK, YOU NOW HOLD THE MASTER SWORD."" from Fi.  The creation of the Master Sword is retconned, and it is made in a way copied from PH.  Cool. Not. This also implies that the people in skyloft are not the Hylians in question from before, as there were people on the surface prior to them.

The game also does not explain anything about the hylian crest (the red bird and the triforce) that is present on the shields.  You get the Hylian Shield in the game, with no mention of Hyrule or anything of the sort, but you see the emblem sans the head of the bird and the triforce all over the place though.

As for characters, I didn't delve too deeply into the sidequests as I wasn't expecting a second helping of Majora's Mask. The game lets you court several of the female NPC's apparently though. Tsk tsk, cheating on zelda? Shame on you.  You get the standard serving of Zelda people with repeated dialogue and grunts with some comedy here and there, (mostly from Groose).

Conclusion:
Yes, I understand that all Zelda is is basically a fetchquest.  Going through three dungeons to get the Master Sword is nothing new.
Going through three dungeons to FORGE the Master Sword is a problem, to me anyway.
I can't really continue with this as it's basically all that needs to be said about this game.
Is it worth the money?  Not really.  From what I've seen people are split and either love it or dislike it.
The game's length is artificially extended.
I'll probably get flamed for writing a negative review of it, but people, I've been making bacon bits out of Ganon since I was four.
For me, this is the Other M of the Zelda series and a sign that maybe Nintendo isn't going to be pumping out stuff like it used to.

This is your baseline and you can only go up from here. As a previous owner with an awesome remote I thought at the price it's being sold, it would be another awesome PS4 remote that would work the same way as my PS3 remote. After having received it, I honestly don't know how this version can sell for this much for something that feels cheap and doesn't work as well or even advertised per the instruction booklet.

First of all, everyone is baffled how Sony cannot provide it's own remote the same way it has provided for the PS3 - twice! And I bought it two times even with the re-design being even better.

Then they offer the PS4 and with no remote.

Now this one pops up and it looks legitimately designed by Sony, but isn't Sony. It's just a licensed product and it doesn't bode too well with us, users who know the PS3 remote too well.

The plastic feels cheap. The buttons are too small. And the functions are limited that you would have to go back to your controller. Defeats the purpose.

The manual states it can control the volume which is their ""punch through"" feature, but it will only work if you use a TV for your speakers which most of those who care about audio and gaming won't. I have studio monitor speakers routed through the receiver as most will have a similar set up. And this feature doesn't work.

Sony needs to come up with it's own official remote so we don't have to deal with cheaply designed and built third party products for it's premium machine.

Overall, this remote control does the basic job of what you need to do but with a multitude of remote controls at home and the price of this remote then that's not enough or acceptable.

I have an Arris HD Recorder cable box that acts as the central recorder for all shows at home and is able to record and push multiple signals to the various rooms around the house by the use of the Arris portal. It's a staple for higher end cable box recorders which has been around for years and years already.

This remote doesn't have a code for the Arris and that's a fail for a remote that just came out.

So with no volume punch through for receivers and no control for my cable box, it's just a limited cheaply built with small buttons remote that a PS4 controller can do.",Cheap build quality with control limitations.,1448496000,5,,

Tap B again to smash its head with your hammer. You get the idea. Boring.

Here's the basic premise: two monsters fight it out on a board, and the one with the higher HP wins. That's it. However, the process by which you get to this point is almost utterly incomprehensible, requiring you to build decks of cards, use sixaxis motion control, exploit certain field advantages, and even use a modicum of strategy. You see, before this battle even starts, you have to lay out certain cards on the field (called ""gate cards""), and, by using a variety of motions on the sixaxis controller, you have to throw and steer your bakugan onto these cards. During this process, you can collect a number of power ups, depending on the battlefield, and can also be hit with certain status effects, etc. Once you land on a card, you can claim it in one of three ways...blah blah blah.

Here's the weird thing: despite the huge number of things you need to do to set up a battle, battles are remarkably repetitive. I mean, no matter the field element, no matter the rules, everything feels...pretty much the same. And ultimately, this is the downfall of Bakugan - there isn't enough other stuff going on to break the monotony of these battles. I mean, no one will deny that pokemon is incredibly repetitive, battle-wise. Yet, you still have the ability to explore a world. In Bakugan, you are pretty much limited to four environments, two of which offer nothing but battles, one of which is a store, and the last one is your room. You don't actually move your character - the environments are static, and you are offered choices (in your room, e.g., you can ""change clothes,"" ""check personal stats,"" ""check rankings"" and ""save"".).

Another problem with this game is that it is very, very easy. I have no problem making a game accessible to a younger audience (and since this game arises from a television cartoon series, it's clear that this is the target audience). But there is little to nothing even approaching strategy in this one. If you aren't strong enough, you just fight in the park against opponents until you can power up your creatures or deck. Even a poorly made deck can win a lot of battles (and since there are only 9 cards in a deck, three of which are the creatures you fight with, it's not so hard to figure out what's going on). You are already two tourneys into the game before the enemies even become normal difficulty.

There is a story in the game. It is completely forgettable.

There is one big plus: the cel-shaded graphics look quite nice. Pokemon should take a cue for its next outing on the Wii.

There is a kernel of a good idea here: this is one of the very, VERY few titles that the sixaxis controls actually improve (although I don't know if that's merely because everything is so repetitive). The weird mix of things to do is oddly charming, but it just never comes together. Sure, you can roll your bakugan around the arena collecting powerups, but why would you? Most battles can be won without them (particularly since the minigames power up your character incredibly, and you will ALWAYS beat the computer). As a multiplayer game, this might be OK. But I don't play multiplayer, and since it lacks an online component, most others won't, either.

1 - Bad connection while using your mouse in a surface like your bed foam.. Most mouses i have used in the past don't have this problem. So i assume This gaming mouse will work on hard tables better. Though many people will like having mouse that work on virtually every surface.

2- The battery runs out quicker than i had anticipating. With time, the mouse cursor becomes slow and imprecise due to low battery life, which is itself a frustration. The batter should go out 0 or 1. My last mouses stopped altogether when battery ran out rather than Slowing down. This frustration adds to the previous one and makes overall experience miserable.

3- Buttons as many but they are placed in weird spot. Though you will be happy to customize different buttons with many functions but in the end, it will be a pain to press some extra function buttons as swiftly and quickly as you had initially hoped. So in a sense, it is a bad design. The mouse might catch customer's eyes who wants more buttons, but this means delivering only half the product as promised, because buttons are useless if you can't press them swiftly and comfortably.

-The game is fun for the most part when it's working right, and if you can stand the boring cut scenes that you can't skip.
-Unlocking things is relatively fun.
-There's a lot of replay value to missions, redoing them under different criteria, and an online mode.
-Actual FPS, with okay touch controls.

Bad
-The in game movie sequences are unskipable, not as cool as the developers probably thought, and even if they were they probably wear down on the second and third viewing since they're built into the missions and unskipable.
-This game is HORRIBLY glitchy. I'm shocked none of the reviews touch on it, but Google around. To name some glitches I've personally had.
The game froze. Each time you get something such as a headshot, it displays that you gained an accolade. It has to display each one individually. I amassed something like a multi kill (must display each individually and a multikill), rank up, headshots, bronze weapon usage, stealth kill all at once. It was too much and it froze the game. Sometimes you can see the game stuttering to get multiple awards out.
I was doing a stealth run and my Ally AI decided to go Rambo on all the unsuspecting enemies. As usual autosave messed everything up so the mission had to be restarted from scratch. Very frustrating.
I fell through the floor at one point and through several floors of the level, dying. Very frustrating.

Glitches seem to primarily happen when you replay missions, only once did I have something happen in the main story.
The game decided to stop spawning enemies at the end of a (in my personal opinion) long mission. I could not complete the mission and autosave ensured suiciding did not work. By the way killing yourself eats into your funds.

-Also annoying is that the multiplayer seems to have connection issues and a low player count. The two combined make for a bad experience. The skill level of the people I played against was very low in spite of them being much higher than me. They just seemed to constantly trigger vanguards (think COD Care package) and then let me steal them and go around killing them. I'd almost think they were bots they are just so terrible.
-The weapons are not as cool as you'd think. Somehow the shotgun that lights people on fire just isn't awe inspiring.
-Because the game uses the typical system where you are ""Rewarded for everything you do"", it has the flaws of the other games that do this (such as Bulletstorm). Shooting barrels to blow people up is really fun and cool for example, but doesn't reward you near as much as a simple headshot, to give one example.

2.0,False,"09 13, 2008",A2M7CLVA0KIHQF,B000QCU9I0,J.S. Knapp,"It's depressing when one of your most anticipated game releases leaves you wishing you had bought something else.  Sixty bucks is a lot of money to waste.

The first Mercenaries title was - in my opinion - a major milestone.  Taking the Grand-Theft-Auto sandbox design and filling it with military vehicles, crazy gun fights and massive explosions.  The original game was not without its flaws, but I actually think this game has far more.

The Cons:

Oh goodness the graphics.  I think a lot of gamers feel that graphics are an aside - as much as graphics are touted by major reviewers, publications, etc, us gamers just don't really seem to care that much.  If a game is really, REALLY good, we'll look past some frame rate issues and bad aliasing.  But Mercs 2 - good God - did they port this off of a Gameboy??  When you're in a race and obstructions literally pop up in front of you around a corner - that's not good.  When an enemy is shooting at you from 50 yards away and yet the engine hasn't actually drawn him yet - that's not good.  The colors are extremely flat - trees, buildings, people - almost all look the same.

Topography is another issue - many times I've watched my character get killed because I was literally stuck in a rut the depth of a curb.  I've also gotten stuck between rocks many, many times.  It is incredibly frustrating watching an action game turn into a platformer because you're trying to jump out from a few rocks.

Fun...  The game just isn't that fun.  A lot of strategy has been compromised for action and explosions - neither of which are that good.  In the original mercs, you could subdue a ""high value target"" - referred to in that game as a ""deck of cards.""  You could then take your subdued target, toss him into a vehicle (The Hummer H2 was my favorite) and drive out of an enemy base, camouflaged as a civilian.  This was one of my favorite things to do.  So imagine my surprise when I knocked out a HVT in Mercs 2, ran up to my truck, and couldn't load the target inside.  In the following explosion, my HVT was killed and I lost half of my bounty.  Why did they take that element out of the game?

The air support has become bigger and in some ways, better.  There are a LOT of things you can call in this time, and you don't have to worry about keeping a faction happy to keep the supplies rolling in.  However, you have to stop moving, select what you want to call in, and throw your beacon for things like artillery support, fuel bombs, etc.  Of course, most of the time you'll catch a rocket in the face for your efforts because you're not moving!  Why you have to stop to throw an air support beacon is beyond me.  This was obviously never beta-tested.

The story - if you can call it that - is pretty poor.  There's no indication as to when missions become available - you literally have to make your rounds among your increasing number of outposts and H.Q.'s and find out what is available to do.  The first couple times I found myself thinking, ""now what?"" only to realize that I had to go talk to someone to find out what was available.  I guess it's good that Fiona - your... ...boss?... ...keeps nagging you to return home so she can give you suggestions.

Good Lord the voice acting...  I don't know if the same guy did Mattias as in the last game, but he obviously spent some time hanging out in suck city between projects.  He is without a doubt the worse voice-actor I've ever heard.  Was this guy trying to impersonate Shatner?  It is literally so bad, I've begun skipping the conversations simply because I can't stand it.

So what's good?  The vehicles are okay - I really liked the combat ship I stumbled across - rocket launcher, two side-mounted turret guns and a butt-kicking front-mounted cannon.  The helicopters are more varied and capable - sorta...  My favorite part was using a helicopter to drop a gigantic gas tank onto the deck of a large tanker ship - the ship was a target I was asked to destroy.  The gas tank landed next to two additional gas tanks on the deck, and after a few seconds of bouncing around, the first tank exploded, igniting the other two.  As the ship exploded in a glorious fireball, I sat there laughing almost uncontrollably - it was just cool.  Too bad it took 6 hours of game play to find a good part.

What else would you like to know?  No, the physics aren't any better.  Driving is a tiny bit easier, but cars slide like you're driving on teflon-coated ice...  They stop okay and such, but get out of a car while it's still just slightly moving, and you'll walk a half-mile to catch up to it - that is if it doesn't slide off a cliff or beach.

Mercenaries 2 is... ...it's an insult to the engineers who made Mercs 1 such a great game.  Gone is the flair - no neat animations when you subdue a target.  Instead we get minute-long tank hijacking sequences.  For every item Mercs 2 tried to improve on the original, they slacked off on two items that Mercs 1 did great.

To those people, lay off the kool-aid and try not to ride the PR train next time. Or at least become a shill and get payed while doing so.

Upon completing this game, I was very disappointed by it.
First, while previous RE games were spooky and had great ""zombie"" creepiness(REmake anyone?) this one can be best summarized as black men with blood shot eyes riding motorcycles. What happened to this series?

Whoever came up with the ""daylight horror"" during preproduction meetings at Capcom should have his head examichopped off. There are no scares, no horror atmosphere worthy of Resident Evil name. The entire franchise has become a derivative action slugfest. Some people might say this shift kinda started with RE4, sure, but RE5 pretty much goes way past it and feels like nothing more than House of the Dead game, with the rails turned off accompanied by a slower, less responsive pointing laser. Kick the door in, pop some infected Africans, rinse and repeat.
Game is extremely linear, there is no exploration, no backtracking to unlock previous areas with newly acquired toys. Even the shock value is pretty much gone, rest in pieces window jumping canines. All you do is mow down very slow moving infected villagers that act more like practice dummies than a threat. They ride motorcycles and even use conventional weapons near the end of the game. Isn't there some unspoken rule zombies don't do that written somewhere. What, they're not zombies anymore? Then what are you calling this a RE game for. Might as well go with nazi vampires for next one. Head hurts.

Resident Evil worked Capcom(REmake), you tried to fix what wasn't broken(RE4), and you broke it(RE5). It only took time to realize it.

Ok, so it's not a remarkable survival horror game, neither was RE4 but that was a good action game. Back in 2005.
Resident Evil 5 is a bad(dated?) action game. It tries to copy RE4 and slap a new paint job on it, but 4 years have passed. Not being able to move and shoot is unacceptable in 2009 for an action game. It works in survival horror adventure games, in which you spend more time anticipating the combat encounters than the actual combat, AND where action isn't the focus of the game. It doesn't work in an action game. It never did, and the moment the competition arrived it showed how outdated RE4 controls truly were. No, don't kid yourself fanboys, this game is in the same genre as Gears of Wars and Dead Space - a behind the shoulder action game. The problem is both these already released games control and are designed much better than what Capcom just spew out. If that wasn't insulting enough, GeoW2 can be more creepy at times than RE5 and it controls better too! I'm not even going to talk about Dead Space, which blew everyones mind how well it turned out. A game from EA no less /facepalm. Maybe, just maybe, there is hope for System Shock 3.

Terrible tank controls, restrictive movement, slow aiming controls, awful cover implementation.

Moving on, the aggressiveness of the enemies - or lack thereof. I've lost count the number of times a mob of enemies run up to me, then sloooowly started to circle around me waiting to be shot down one by one. This isn't anything new, RE4 had the same ridiculous mechanic. Like the game is trying to tell you both movement and aiming controls are implemented the wrong way, so we have to make the enemies that look at you for the most part, while you slowly, in stationary position, aim for the head shots. Let's face it, if the zombies from Left 4 Dead or the mutated freaks from Dead Space showed up you would never make it past the first level with these controls. Sure, there are some mini bosses which are a step up in the right direction, but they're either so slow you can run circles around them(executioner) or so trivial(chainsaw guy) it makes no difference. Then again, we get others later on that wouldn't be amiss in a railgun game where you don't even need to move, and let's not forget the ever annoying quick time events, hope you don't mind those.

It gets better! Not only are the controls terrible, you are stuck with an African co-op partner(skin tone not too black, just enough not to be white) who is terrible at ammo/health items conservation. Combined that with a limited inventory and that you can't drop items to pick up later if you're full, and you end up with an annoying micro management side game that is well past outstaying its welcome by the time you fly off in the chopper. Also a helpful hint, watch her ammo, she sprays it like they kidnapped her poodle and beat it in a sack while making her watch.
Thankfully, if you play online and allow another person to control her rather than ai this fairs much better. Then again, if you want to play co-op zombie action game with other people, I suggest you look into Left 4 Dead.

Only redeeming quality this game has? It looks and sounds OUTSTANDING. I wouldn't be surprised if Capcom has legions of talented artists chained to their desks working them 24/7.

I have a Vita Slim, and have a silicone sleeve. I actually cut the sleeve up a bit to accommodate these grips since they add a little bulk to the analog sticks, only to have them fall off.

I played Age of Zombies (twin stick shooter) for about 40 minutes and both analog grips fell off three times during gameplay, not to mention that before they fall off they become loose, which really messes up gameplay because you can feel it happening.

I also applied the D-pad grip, and it doesn't even line up properly.

Unlike some other reviewers, I did get a matching set of each grip, so I guess that's good. I am frustrated because I think these would be perfect if they just fit properly. Now I feel like I'm $10 short with a bunch of useless rubber nubs and a sliced up silicone sleeve.

First, the good:

The game looks great. It takes advantage of the ps3 hardware and really make it feel alive. I had someone replacing the tile walk by a few times, and he didn't notice it was a game until the 3rd time he walked by.

The voice overs are very well done. They are meshed well to sound like real comments being made by announcers. As you play it more, they will get a bit repetitive, but they still did a pretty good job here.

The Bad:

The Gameplay!!!!

Okay, on to the specifics.

The batting interface with the Sixaxis controller sucks. It is hard to see where a ball is heading ahead of time unless you get lucky with the batter's eye and as a result most will take lots of swings at balls that are nowhere close. It can also get somewhat tiring constantly shoving the controller out.. and you will do it pretty hard if you want to hit homers.

Speaking of home runs.. wow. I guess the game assumes EVERYONE is on steroids, but good lord it is easy to knock it out of the park. Tilt the controller back, time it right, and boom.. gone. This is balanced out by the cpu robbing you frequently and knocking it out of the park all the time itself. Maybe I am remembering baseball wrong.. but I don't remember people hitting home runs 3-4 times a game.

On the subject of robbing: This is the part that just got to me the most because it was so ridiculous. Here was the final straw for me: game 7 of the world series: down by 1, bottom of the 9th, 1 man on. There are 2 outs and the count is 1-2. I got a good line on the ball coming in and CRACK, GONE!! oh wait, the fielder climbs on the fence AGAIN and robs you of your home run AGAIN. This might be disheartening once, but when this is the FOURTH TIME that game that you were robbed of a home run it is just plain ridiculous.

Finally: base management. Stealing bases and moving your people around the bases after a hit is NOT easy. It is doable, but it is a major pain and mistakes are easy to make.

Overall, this was an okay game. But the gameplay.. especially the constant robbing of home runs just ruins it. My blood pressure was higher playing this game than any other game I've played before and I was ordered to take it back by my girlfriend before I broke the controller. Some might enjoy it, but you might want to experience the ridiculousness of the game itself as a rental first before forking over the cash to buy it.","Beautiful game, but the fun?

2.0,False,"03 18, 2010",A949OA2TPM0B1,B002AB7TX8,Ryan,"As immersive as video games are nowadays, it is still hard to put players into a particular emotional state, be it happiness, sadness, anger, or fear. Without really trying to, early video perhaps succeeded most directly with the emotion of fear.  Rather than fear of death, early video games provided a sense of dread regarding failure, as it would mean the loss of substantial progress through a ""level"".  This was a very pragmatic design choice for a pay-per-play arcade game, and the format carried through to the early years of home video gaming, but as computer game design and understanding of the way people enjoy games advanced, formats that penalize the player for failure with the loss of significant progress faded into history.

The awkwardly named Demon's Soul's for the PS3 is a unique action RPG game that has made the bold choice to revisit the idea of generating sweaty palms through the use of heavily penalizing player failure.  Was it the right design decision?  Although this single aspect of the game will ultimately be what is remembered about the game, there are other noteworthy aspects of the game to talk about.

First of all, the combat is sublime.  I was never a point-and-click Diablo action RPG fan, and although I thoroughly enjoy modern action RPGs like Mass Effect, Fallout 3 and Oblivion, hand to hand combat has never really seemed right until now.  Demon's Soul's has an intuitive combat system that provides an amazing degree of flexibility in tactical sword-to-sword combat.  You can block, parry and riposte similar to something like Assassin's Creed, but unlike AC, which devolves into a simple timing challenge, every combat situation in Demon's Soul's presents some problem solving.  Monsters attack in somewhat predictable patterns, but the patterns are only subtly observable, rewarding (requiring) close attention on the first or 100th low level zombie you cut a swath through.  There's also ranged combat, which while not as interesting as the sword-play, does get the job done.

The game also does some unique things with multiplayer.  You can see and leave messages for other people to see in their single player game and see how other people are ""dying"" in their own games.  This is useful as you explore new areas, but can be frustrating as well.  In my game over half the messages say ""Help me I'm in trouble.  Please recommend this message."" What?  There are also ways to invite or enter other people's games to help or attack them, but I really didn't explore that aspect of the game.

Problem solving is a large element of Demon's Soul's.  At every enemy, at every fork in the ""level"", you must be thinking; keeping track of which items are equipped, how many arrows you have, whether the next turn in the hallway will expose your back to a hidden foe.  The level designs and some of the choices presented to the player require some unorthodox thinking.  For example, during your quest through the castle you come to a fork in the hallway.  To the left is a knight with red eyes, not unlike the knights with blue eyes, many of which you have defeated previously.  To the right is a long exposed bridge with many low level soldiers.  Which way would you go?  Remember, the loss of many experience points and perhaps 20 minutes or more of gameplay rides on this decision.  Suppose you decide to take on the red-eyed knight.  You advance cautiously with a conservative plan of attack (keep your shield up and go for openings with your quicker attack).  This works for the first few hits, and you make a small dent in his HP, but then the knight knocks you off balance with a heavy swing and eviscerates you with one hit.  Death.

...15 minutes later you battle back to the fork and decide to try the bridge.  As you advance you hear loud wing-beats and before you really even start to cross the bridge an enormous dragon swoops in and levels half the enemies on the bridge in his attempt to roast you in your armor like a baked potato in the oven.  You race back down to the safety of the enclosed hallway to consider the situation...cautiously you creep back out to the now somewhat less guarded bridge and again the dragon swoops in.  This time you peel off an arrow at the dragon before retreating and see a minuscule reduction in its hit points.  As this is level 1-1, you conclude you are probably not ready to defeat this foe.  More experimentation confirms the dragon will always pop out to the bridge when you do.  Perhaps the red-eyed knight isn't so tough after all.

...After numerous wasted attempts to beat the knight, you finally realize (maybe you are smarter than me, but I eventually just looked it up on Youtube) that you can't beat EITHER of these foes and actually what you need to do is time a run PAST the dragon in order to continue through level 1-1.  ...Of course.  Oldest trick in the book.  Learn the AI pattern and exploit it to continue past.

And therein lies the problem.  The game has wonderful combat and the levels are stimulating and fun to explore, but the merciless nature of dying and losing progress is ultimately a detriment to the game.

I got this game hoping it would be like Big game hunter ultimate challenge for ps1. Cabela really should have took the time on this game. but they didnt, they seemingly just made it and threw it altogether without a thought but to gain profit. Now i aint downing Cabela because they make the best dad gum hunting games. but this was just horrible. I love to use the bow on hunting games, and the bullistics on this game are just impossible and make the game horrible. You have to get within 70 yrds with the compound for a clean kill, 30 with the recurve in real life. Sadly, they didn't seem to realize that the stealth meter is so lame, It was obviously made to be hunting with firearms. Rifles to be specific as the shotgun is about like shooting a handgun on that game. So let me refrain, give you a little idea of what your buying.  First gun i used to go hunting was the 223. handgun that shoots rifle loads. i crept up on a blacktail and glassed it with binoculars, at about 180 yrds. I was crouched, which is supposed to up your stealth meter, but unless you don't move, it drops real low even while crouched, so you'd be better off running. the Buck was laying down with its back to me, i pulled out my pistol and realised i was too far away for a decent shot, i sprayed scent cover and crept forward. As soon as i pushed the analog stick the stealth meter dropped down and the buck up and bolted. Frustrated i fired a shot at it with the 223.and bullet cam was on, so i got to watch the bullet go straight to the ground at the bucks feet as he bolted over the hill and into  the blue. Leaving me to think how bad the ballistics on the game sucked and how that should of hit him. a 223. doesnt begin to drop until 250 yrds. i was well within the range of a straight shot but failed, due to bad ballistics. The bow is impossible, you'll never get close enough to actually hit your target, the game aint designed that way. Finally after too many failed shots to count, i began to just chase em' down with the truck or atv and jump off right by em' and pluck em' like a madman with my 357. which if thats cabelas game designers idea of close range hunting, thats extremely funny. However the 270. rifle and sly planning led to me nearly beating even this impossible caper of a game. It was designed for hunting with the rifle, But people want a variety of firearms so Cabela thought, Hey, Bows and handguns! well, they don't work.

If you are considering getting this for a Wii, make sure that Wii has GCN controller ports; new Wiis don't have them.

By design, I don't mean the shape of the controller or the placement of the buttons/d-pad/sticks, I mean the way it's built. It feels really cheap (even for a third-party controller), the buttons are terribly clunky, and the d-pad is unresponsive when it's not perfectly centered. Also probably worth noting is that the L&R buttons can feel unresponsive as well; that's because they are pressure-sensitive but also built mostly like digital buttons, and most GameCube games don't respond at the slightest touch of the L and R triggers.

This is really unfortunate because no one else makes a controller that lets you customize the buttons' input. The idea is great because some games have really awkward and/or just plain uncomfortable button set-ups, so if this thing wasn't so terribly designed, it would be the ideal controller to have.

For one thing the main actor is an immature acting 25ish male. The relationship between Fenton and his Asian love interest would be bewildering to anyone less that eight and the (bloodless) shootings are probably inappropriate to anyone under ten. Yet the gameplay is only point and click with no time-pressure and very few surprises so it wouldn't be much of a challenge to anyone over, say, eighteen.

Now I do understand that the 10-18 year old male segment of society is a major demographic when it comes to video games but even in this segment the majority would prefer Halo over Nancy Drew.

The graphics and animation are at least 10 years out of date. The voice characterizations are uneven, trending towards poor. Whoever voiced Fenton should be given acting lessons. The best characterization was the annoying kid with the fishing pole followed by the British soldier Fenton rescues from the Nazi camp. In fact - that character should have voiced Fenton.

The game mainly consists of clicking on things and moving things. Be sure to right-click (get description) on everything. Some key items actually change their form when you do this and you cannot progress until you have done it. Sometimes obvious stuff doesn't do what you expect and the game designers have made some really weird assumptions about how people think. When two items go together or an item goes in a place the cursor will change - I often found myself just picking everything up and trying it with everything else and in every place until the cursor changed.

1. The campaign is awesome, unless your fighting limitless amount of zombies. Which you end up doing about 80% of the time. Having said that, the campaign is not awesome. It gets very repetitive and just out right boring having to shoot the same twisted looking dudes running at you over and over again.

It is also just too short, Halo 2's campaign kept you interested while Halo 3's  makes you never want to play it again.

2. The multiplayer, I am not really sure why people play this game to be honest. Its just down right aweful. The team play has absolutely zero strategy, which typically results in half of your team mates running to get the overshield or the shotgun, and when you get it first you typically are betrayed (killed) by your team mate so he take your recently acquired goodies.
Also if you are an adult, the constant barrage of 10 year olds talking smack or making obscene noises and/or tea bagging you after they kill you, will get old very quickly. You simply cannot play one night without running into one of these idiots.
The last bug in Halo 3, is the horrible game play on the multiplayer. I don't know how many times I have shot someone point blank to the face with a shot gun, only to be beaten down. Or on two occasions (when viewing the games in theater) bullets that completely miss my body and/or head that still result in a instant kill, or the bullet shooting 150 degrees out of the sniper rifle into my head. That was my favorite.

However, what I do like about Halo 3 is Bungie's website. They catalogue all your medals, your recent game scores and diagrams of your kills on the maps, your rank and how much more skill you need to rank up, your screen shots, your theater movies. All of that is pretty cool, and is a sort of collection to your time on Halo 3.

You do more flying around then interesting activities. Provox should have provided interplanetary jump capability to anywhere within 50,000 miles or so. the need a better orientation system on the HUD. Currently you have to enable the grid on screen and callup the map, cumbersome.

There are some other irritating things like targeting lock and fighting around stations. If you fire too close to a station it will retaliate and end the conflict right there. Stations should have shielding that can handle stray firing that doesn't match what meteor showers can do.

Some of the quests are overwhelming and others don't make sense. They don't seem to offer enough credits for the trouble. The trading with cargo ships seems like what you get from the station. I have not explored that option much, like maybe for the narcotics contraband you get from pirate conquests you might get a good deal for needed items.

Two irritating things get my head banging on the keyboard.
1) Meteor showers that you can't seem to outrun or jump away from except to the station.
2) The ship constantly degrades on durability and constantly needs repair of that, especially from shield failure and meteor showers!  As it degrades your ship's performance will suffer. I don't know if upgrading shield or armor will fix that.

I don't know about the other character profiles but the best choice was Soldier. Otherwise at the opening fight I would get creamed almost every time.

Getting enough upgrades for reasonable credits seems to take forever. You get biggest pay from quests. Second best is pirate hunting, but after a while pirates can be hard to find. If you upgrade your energy cells to 20% you can mine and harvest floating scrap. Cycle radar for different scan modes. And that is the only way you can find the parts for the time and cloak technology. But you don't get much for your efforts. This makes the game tedious.

It would be nice to be able to land on planets to explore or mine.

If your lucky you can get or find a snip tool that enhances your turbo gun about 3x. You can take down your enemies quite effectively and forget about the missiles. But it does fire more slowly.

The message center is a joke. Why couldn't you get useful messages like pirate sightings or other useful intel.

Not having any guides other then the AI makes the game frustrating and tedious. Why produce a game without a manual or help interface, except for that nagging AI?

The politics is complicated and adds to the complexity of the game. The story line is poor, and they mix it in with the major quests.

If Provox can fix those discrepancies then perhaps they will have decent game. As of now I won't buy it. I have all kinds of suggestions how they could make the game better

The absolute best part of the game is the online play. The game offers only six courses, and after you finish unlocking everything (which can be done in a weekend if you're a veteran player), there wouldn't be much left to do - but online tournaments are a blast and will keep you playing as long as you want.

To the bad - and the 2 stars portion of the review. There are only six courses. With the amount of space on a Blu Ray disc, there could be 30. I understand that may not be feasable, but these aren't levels in an action game or platformer. This is the classic ""buy our downloadable content later"" strategy - and that just sucks. The graphics are mediocre. I don't see a huge difference between this and what was possible on last generations consoles, especially with the small number of characters (15), no store to purhcase things (they just get unlocked semi-randomly), and only six courses.

I also have to mention the new advanced shot mode. It's terrible. You still will be timimg your swings with button presses, but it adds a lot more guess work. I'd rather see a analog stick swing if they are going to try something differnt. As it stands I only used it when there were tournaments with special rules mandating advanced shots.

As it stands, if you've never played it is a blast. For veterans, the Playstation store download of Hot Shots Golf 2 is just as good - and a heck of a lot cheaper.","Another ""Next Gen Update""",1218326400,2,,

2.0,False,"09 1, 2015",A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B00K2O5310,Adrian Jenkins,"After being enthralled by Season 2 of The Walking Dead (heretofore named ""TWD2""), I decided to purchase The Wolf Among Us (heretofore named ""TWAU""). The game only cost a little less than four dollars for all 5 episodes, so there wasn't much at stake here. But despite this, I still come away incredibly disappointed.

Let's begin with the good: TWAU has some of the best art of any game I've played on the system. As is custom, Telltale eschews realistic images for more cartoon-y characters, and the result is fantastic. Ignoring the Fables connection (which is difficult, I'll grant), the story is a well-crafted noirish detective tale, populated by well-voiced characters. The game (I think) is meant to be set in the late 80s/early 90s, and the background music really supports this. It literally sounds like a soundtrack from a movie of that period, with heavy, muddled synthesizer driving a relatively simple (but also hypnotic) melody. This is particularly true for the intro to each episode, which just really plays out great.

Unfortunately, two things really bring this crashing down. The first is the horrible technical problems of the game. This game froze on me three separate times, and for a mostly linear point-and-click game, this is unacceptable. In fact, it reminded me of playing point-and-click back in the 80s, when quality of product was often low. Autosave is the biggest culprit, although one freeze occurred quite randomly. Moreover, the autosave often caused skips in the otherwise-excellent soundtrack. Unacceptable.

The second problem is the Fables universe itself. I'll admit up front that I've never been a fan either of the series or its author. But regardless, unless you are a fanboy of the highest order, I don't see how a person could believe that the Fables aspect adds much to the proceedings. Where do I begin with the issues?

1) There are far too many fables introduced here. Moreover, all of them are scum. At no point did I have a whit of sympathy or emotional attachment to any of the characters, which is a problem in a game that tries to base itself on the player making hard choices. I didn't really care if Bigby Wolf (our protagonist) acted out of kindness, spite, or whatever. I certainly didn't care if, e.g., I killed another piece of trash in the game, or if I sent a non-human character to ""The Farm"". This game should have had four or five fables, existing within a human (""mundy"") universe, as this would have added much more weight to many of the decisions here. And in any case, do I really think that the choices made over the course of a few days have any impact on beings who have lived for centuries (by their own admission)?

2) Speaking of human universe, where IS the human universe? Some humans popped up in the story for about five minutes, to never be seen again. I couldn't understand why our protagonist (or anyone else) cared whether or not fables appeared as humans. There aren't any humans around, as far as I could tell. Again, Fabletown is interesting only in the sense that it exists within the human universe. Otherwise, one might as well set this in the fairy tale realm from which these losers came. Without humans, it's like I'm visiting a foreign country. One of the crappy ones.

3) Why is every fable a piece of trash? We get it - there are no happy endings. But couldn't one or two fables be decent, err, human beings? Again, how am I supposed to feel empathy (or even sympathy) for a burly drunk who beats up women? Or a mouthy administrator who couldn't give two craps about the people she supposedly works for? I was reminded of Raylan Givens thought to Eva in the final episode of Justified (rephrased for my purposes here): why do trashy fables think that people should feel pity for them simply because they're NOT being trash at one particular moment? Again, these are (mostly) immortal beings, and most of them act worse than the worst trailer trash you've ever met. Probably, this is a carry-over from the comic (which I have mostly avoided); Bill Willingham has never been one for subtlety (or plot development, or much of anything else for that matter). Maybe if the source material was written by Neil Gaiman...but I digress.

The point is this: unless you are a MASSIVE fan of the Fables series, I can't see a world where you would possibly care about the choices these wastes of space make in their lives. Telltale might as well have created a game based on meth heads who kill children for their lunch money to fuel their habits. I would have probably done the same thing there: tried to find a way to ensure maximum misery for every single inhabitant of this world. And that leads to the final issue:

4) Once you fail to care about the choices in this world, the gameplay obviously doesn't support a playthrough. It's the standard ""hit this button a lot"" or ""push the stick in this direction"" that's been going on since the days of Dragon's Lair.

Long story longer, there's just nothing here like what is found in TWD or TWD2. I would strongly advise possible purchasers of this game to look there first. That being said, if you can find this for the price at which I found it, the art alone is worth the purchase. But for twenty dollars? Buyer beware.","Forget it, kid - it's Fabletown",1441065600,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

2.0,False,"10 20, 2011",A2RT20DNPFZGAF,B004DTU0W2,Anonymous,"For a controller with an MSRP higher than a standard Microsoft controller, you would think you would get something at least the same quality, but unfortunately this controller feels quite cheap and while it does a few things right, it gets most of them wrong.

First off, this is a wired controller. I personally don't mind about this since you don't have to worry about batteries dying on you. The cord is braided and long enough to play from several feet away so this wasn't an issue to me. As a side effect, it seemed like the rumble feature was stronger, since it doesnt have to worry about battery life and the rumble draining it.

Going with the weight of the controller, it feels a little too light and flimsy. The plastic shell feels kind of cheap, though the rubberized coating is a nice touch. Its about the same size as a Microsoft controller, though less rounded with more straight edges. It felt roughly the same in my hands though.

The analog sticks on the tournament edition are adjustable which let you twist the sticks to adjust the tension. A good idea in theory, but executed poorly in this case. When tightened the movement just doesnt feel right and is uneven where you have to apply more pressure the further you push the stick. It just makes the analog sticks feel worn out and old doing this. However, when loosened all the way, the sticks did feel fine so I just left it at this setting.

The 2nd feature of the tournament edition which the standard didn't have, was the light up A B X Y buttons. It seemed like a nice feature until you realize that its very distracting when you're playing in a dark room and the buttons are very bright. Its like going to a movie theater and having someone whose got their cellphone on a few rows ahead of you. It just takes your attention away from the screen where it should be. The buttons themselves get some getting used to. They're a lot lower than the standard controllers buttons and instead of having to push down on them until the rubber part clicks in, its instead the same as a mouse button and takes little effort to push down until it clicks in. I guess its more of a preference of which style you prefer.

The triggers seemed ok for the most part, although I did not like the way they were angled. It would have been more ergonomic to angle them further down so when you pull the triggers, it pulls in horizontally toward you, instead of vertically with the controller. The LB and RB buttons are different on this controller, and it takes more pressure to push down on them than the standard controller. They felt a bit cheap. The interesting thing is that the LB and RB buttons are behind the programmable buttons which to me was a bit confusing, so instead I just mapped those two buttons to the LB and RB functions, so I have two buttons that do the same thing.

The start and back buttons are poorly place on the bottom of the controller and you have to reach fairly far to get to them. Theyre flush with the shell so its a little difficult hitting the button sometimes.

The DPAD, unfortunately, is the absolute worst part of this controller. The way this controller was designed apparently, was to only play games that use the thumb sticks to move around and use the DPAD just for action buttons like changing your weapon and things like that. The DPAD consists of four separate buttons that are raised up very high. If you want to play a side-scroller or fighting game with this controller, you will have A LOT of difficulty doing so. The DPAD was just a horrible idea. Even as action buttons, the standard DPAD on the Microsoft controller does a better job.

In all, I suggest trying this controller out first if possible before buying it. The two features of the tournament edition- adjustable sticks and light up buttons, are not worth the extra money. This just feels like a cheap cash in, and Ive read a lot of complaints of the controller failing after a few months and Razers support being awful. At its price point and with all its shortcomings, I just cant recommend this controller.  2/5

2.0,True,"11 4, 2014",A38EAEOIEWZS0F,B00KSQACMM,C.J.,"UPDATE: 03/15/16

The plastics on these things are terrible.  Not only have both extension arms broken on my pair, but so have 2 of my friends' pairs.  My pair hung on the extremely over-priced stand from Turtle Beach and were never under ""undue"" stress.  I've since epoxied mine back together and have looked to brace them with a thin metal exo skeleton on the arms, but this should not have been necessary.  Due to the price, this is necessary to avoid wasting a LOT of money.  Do yourself a favor and skip these.

While the sound on these things are indeed excellent, you won't be able to here anything when the cups are bowed away from your ears due to the inferior plastics.

UPDATE 11/7/14:

TLDR:  Sound great, usability is weak.

The Details:

The sound is top notch and the ability to hear yourself in the headset is a huge plus.  I've heard little details that I have never heard before.  I've got a pretty nice audio set up with Martin Logan speakers in front and Pinnacle 3-Element speakers in the rear all being pushed by an Elite receiver and an SVS cylinder for low end.  In order to hear this level of detail from my set up, I would have to crank the volume to a level that wouldn't be acceptable in a family home.  These cans put the audio right next to your ear without it sounding like you're standing next to a speaker.

The mic is sensitive enough that, when combined with the 3 levels of personal audio, I can hear most of the things going on in the house even though I've got the cans on.  This is a big plus for anyone with kids.  I haven't really played with all of the various pre-sets on these things yet, because I found the default to be quite good.

All is not roses and rainbows however:

Charging is a problem as described by other reviewers.  (most disconcerting is the lack of a removable battery pack)  Over-all the buttons on the mic side can are harder to manage than the other side due to the mic protruding from the center of the can.  A better design would have put the mic on the edge.  The center mount is only necessary if the cans were reversible but they are not.  The angle of the cups makes wearing in the opposite direction a little odd and the direction of sound would be reversed (no option to switch).  This of course would mandate the personal audio wheel be relocated, but that is a design concern.  Oddly, the mic side ear cup is smaller than the other.  This isn't TOO big of a deal, but you will likely feel your ear touch the inside of the cup.  (when I wore in reverse to test this, understanding these are not reversible, my other ear touched the inside of the cup.  I measured depth to verify.)

The only odd occurrence with audio is when I first start using them.  Each time, my party says I sound distant or muffled.  Within a couple of minutes, the issue resolves itself with no adjustment from me, so I am not 100% on the cause.

Over-all, if I could, I would give these 4.5 stars.  Since I can't, I am going with 4 stars.

Because this is not Turtle Beach's first outing with headset design, it is a little annoying that they haven't added simple things larger volume wheels, more tactile buttons, and a separate controller mounted puck for quick muting and volume control.  (The lack of controller mounted puck with mute and volume control means you have to relinquish the controller to make adjustments on the mic side can making their use during game play a little cumbersome.)  At this price point their 15$ stand should have been included.  Those things did not, however, influence the loss of a star.

UPDATE 11/6/14:
Turtle Beach released additional information for failed firmware and a method for getting the device into bootloader mode for a clean install.  The information can be found at the following:

[...]

I had to follow clear to the last step before there was success.  My gear is now at the following versions:

Transmitter (1.2.3)
Headset (1.0.5

The 1 star rating is now a 2.  I will update again in a day or two once I have had time to actually put these things through their paces.  It is nice that Turtle Beach recognized an issue with their headset, not so nice that their promised business day response time was not followed through.  More to come.

OLD:
I pre-ordered these things as soon as I learned about them.  It's hard to believe a truly wireless headset didn't come with the One, and odd that it took so long for one to be released.  (and the premium... ouch)

The reason for the one star:  Bricked.  Opening the package, I decided to RTFM.  The first thing is says is to update the headset.  So I hop on Turtle Beach's website, download their v2.0.4 Ear Force Audio Hub and install it.  It updates immediately to v2.0.5.  It says ""...please attach a Turtle Beach device..."" so I plug the headset in.  The computer updates a driver and the Turtle Beach tool immediately hangs on ""Loading Device"" then goes to ""Load Device Failed."" while advising me to disconnect and reconnect the device.

After a couple rounds of plugging in and unplugging, I sift through the Turtle Beach site and find that I need to plug in both the Transmitter AND the Headset.  Fair enough, my mistake just doing the headset.  I plug in the transmitter first and it recognizes the device.  It then updates the firmware, as expected, and then prompts me to plug in the headset, which I do.  No joy.  Same issue.  I unplug and re-plug the device.  Still no joy.  I then unplug both and plug them back in.  Now neither device is recognized.

I thought, ok.. maybe it still works, it just won't update.  I plug everything into the One as directed by the instructions.  The transmitter just flashes LEDs 2 and 4 without ever going solid.  I can find no literature on this flashing.  I am now dead in the water with what is essentially a DOA device.

All instructions were followed as written online at their website and in the provided documentation.  I can hear some of you saying ""But this isn't a review of the HEADSET!""  Actually, it is.  There was no external or negative test case here.  This headset was provisioned and installed as documentation dictated.  I submitted a trouble ticket to Turtle Beach and am waiting to hear back from them.  If/when I hear back, I will update this review.  For the time being, I am stuck with a 250$ paper weight set.",UPDATE 3 ... broken plastics and inferior quality,1415059200,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The gameplay is pretty dang good, it pulls off shooting really well with the limited (1 analog stick) controls of the PSP, and the combat can be really fun. You can upgrade guns and acquire different gear which adds to the fun of combat.
The unique gameplay mechanic is that you can jump from person to person controlling them. So if you're about to die, quantum leap to your buddy and you're still okay. Or if you need to get behind a weakspot or something.

The issues:
The story has nothing to do with Parasite eve and honestly poor regardless of ties to the series. The ending (no spoilers) ruins things even further especially when you consider the main character and the unlockable shower cutscenes that sorta paint a bad picture (when you tie the ending and it's meaning to this).

The story as a whole comes off as a Sci-fi Channel movie, or basically: Poorly written to the point it's funny.

Enemies are anonymous blobs with no character to them, they honestly come off like bullseye targets with how some of them are designed. And the other issue is; they have nothing to do with the Parasite Eve lore.

The voice acting is a mixed bag with characters saying things that are useful and obvious and repetitive. Aya being the worst one by far, to me it just felt like another strong female lead being written as a weak scared little girl (much how Samus in Other M was written).

I have no idea why they called this Parasite Eve when there's no ties to the original beyond a few call backs, if they called this Monster Shooter it'd probably have been better off and not gotten glares from PE fans and also might have had a better chance at a better story.

Granted, this game isn't as bad as some games in this genre can be, but it's simple not good. The graphics are weak, the sound is weak, the ai is weak and the storyline is weak.  You soon begin to release that this is no way to spent your time.

The first mission requires you to advance through the jungle while the night sets in. It has actually a kind of fitting atmosphere and isn't bad. Although it seems to drag on for too long. But there are some tell-tale signs of weakness.

At the start it is impressed upon you to avoid getting into a fire fight because there are over thousand enemy soldiers deployed in the area. Yet the game forces you down the first person shooter road, because you soon find out that gunning down soldiers is unavoidable, far less trouble and not penalised. The map is to small to circumvent the enemy. At some points ambushes are triggered and you have no choice but to fight it out man-to-man.

I have read some books and a field manual on sniping and it has a lot to do with avoiding standup fights. Sniping is about patience and getting that one shot right, that one shot being aimed at a high important target like a key person or installation. After the shot you relocate as fast as possible. This actually means that you are not there to shoot down everything and the entire mission should be built around that fact, IF your aim is to create a sniping game. But either the designers failed to grasp this essence or they wanted just to create a first person shooter where your weapon of choice is limited to a sniper rifle and a side arm.

If the first mission didn't give you enough hints, the second mission will do. You are now to advance in broad daylight through a village crawling with warned enemy troops. The civilians might or might not betray you and you can't shoot them, because then the game will end. If there was ever made an ill fitting mission for a sniper then this must be the one. And what is more, you simply have no choice in the matter. Any sensible guy would simply pull out and this then was what i proceeded to do.

I think that if someone wants to make a sniper game he should concentrate on what sniping entails. There are excellent books about it and if books aren't inspiring enough there are probably some veteran snipes who can tell you all about it. More could have been made of the interaction between the spotter and the sniper, with the player able to play both,for instance. Fitting missions, maps and story line would have to go along with this.

Simply arming the player with a sniper rifle doesn't turn a first person shooter into a sniping game and a first person shooter with only a sniper rifle is an akward first person shooter to say the least. This game will therefore please nobody.",Pleases nobody,1145232000,,,

I also understand that because of that there was limited time to put together much of a story or to dedicate time to anything but the game play itself. However, I probably could have come up with something a bit more attractive with my zero gaming production experience.

You run around as Nariko, the girl with the red hair, and sometimes as her little sister, Kai. At first I was struck dumb by the quality of the cut scenes. I swear I could count the pores in everyone's skin. So that was a plus. I also enjoyed the button smashing mayhem that was required when playing as Nariko. Unfortunately, video game graphics and button smashing have never sat well with me. It's the story I'm after, flexibility of characters, side-plot, dynamics! All of which Heavenly Sword pushes to the wayside.

So, onwards! We find ourselves in a loosely strung together story that doesn't exactly make me think that I want to save Nariko's people. In fact, if I were Nariko I would have off and smacked those inconsiderate men to kingdom come and back. Either way, Bohan, our evil enemy of the story is attempting to wipe out all of Nariko's people and wishes for nothing but power, power, power. At first I liked him as a character because of his dialogue which was interesting and fun. I would want nothing more than to skewer him for some of the things he says. Of course, that likability fled when I realized he was listening to a giant crow and really had no motivation to kill and destroy except for the act of it. I would have liked to see Flying Fox, one of Bohan's minions, be in Bohan's place. Insanity could, at the very least, been a stand in for a reason! So, the story was...pitiful. Because of this I couldn't really feel for much of the characters. I didn't feel triumphant beating a boss or mildly saddened come the end. Nothing. It was two days of my life in a fog of scantily dressed women with a big sword.

As I said before, all you need is the urge to beat the crap out of your controller and you'll get through the game. Ohh, and be wary of some cut scenes or hero sequences when you're killing a boss. They'll throw buttons at you on the screen that you must dutifully push while missing out on the only thing worth playing the game for: the graphics. And for all those graphics why is it that Nariko looks like she has a giant red squid on her head? Irritating.

I did, however, enjoy some of the sixaxis' abilities to control cannon balls and Kai's arrows. In fact, I loved little Kai. I wish she was in the game more and had a larger repertoire of abilities. But wishful thinking gets you nowhere.

The thing is that the game, as most do, had that potential to be something greater than it was.

Ghostbuster fall down, I leave him down.  If you enjoy a video game version of the Medical Alert braclet commerical, Ghostbusters: The Game is for you!

Besides the repetitive gameplay (you are either shooting ghosts with 1 of 4 weapons, or shooting ghosts and trapping them), the unendurable load times in between deaths (10 seconds, at least), and the puzzles (that aren't brain busters but sometimes take forever because the objects aren't rendered well), what I've found most irritating is the glitches.  I've had to restart several checkpoints because of in-game errors and if you think Peter Venkman gets irritated with Ray sometimes, you haven't seen me having to replay a 15 minute ghost shootout when I was deathly bored the first time.  There are way too many flaws in this game for anyone to pay actual money for it.  Ghost money, maybe.

3 notable examples of errors I enjoyed:  I could not leave the kitchen after killing all of the ghosts because the game didn't register it (the Ghostbusters have to say ""all clear,"" but never did), and in the graveyard a ghost got stuck in a tree on the other side of a wall, so I couldn't trap it and therefore could not advance.  Strange, but no, gentle reader when something is strange in your neighborhood you don't call the Ghostbusters.  You call the nearest resell shop and ask how much they are giving for a used copy of this game.

And the third example, something that actually made me spit:  when you get knocked down, it will happen quite often that the other Ghostbusters, if any of them are standing right next to you, will run away instead of picking you up.  As he returns, he's knocked down and you fail the mission.  That means you have to watch and listen to the same scene, sometimes 20-30 times, depending on the difficulty level.  Fun?  No. Not fun.

What I'd recommend is renting it for a friend and watching them suffer playing it.  Whenever there is a cut scene, ask the victim to call you back in the room so you can watch.  You'll save yourself money, you'll safe yourself grief, you may lose a friend ... so, make sure you invite a so-so friend.","Good for the Story, Bad for the gameplay",1250640000,6,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

2.0,False,"05 26, 2005",AMZCQIDUWDHLC,B0002CHJAA,John. N,"In all honestly, how could a game series take this big of a step backward? I mean even the best or most average of game series' take a while and a few bad sequels to degrade to such a point (example Mega Man X5~X7). How could one even work on the development team with a straight consciousnesses knowing you were developing and planned to release such a inferior product? These are the questions about Xenosaga II that keep me up at night...

But seriously (no I don't say up at odd hours of the night pondering about what Xenosaga II could have, should have been), for as great as the original was and the amount of hype this game received, Xenosaga II is a perfect example of a 'almost' complete bust.

First off, the game is way to short. I was really surprised I was on disc 2 after 7 hours of gameplay. I'm not quite sure, but does Xenosaga II use dual layer DVD's like the first Xenosaga, cause if it does and that's all they put on the first disc, that's pretty sad. It's almost seems they put it on two normal DVD's instead of a dual layer disc just to give the player the illusion that because it's two discs it must be a  long game. Nice marketing tactic guys, gamers aren't as dumb as you think...

Xenosaga II's battle system is absolutely horrendous; it's up there with Legend of Dragoon's battle system in my book (I love to bash that game to no end). Expect to die a few times and spend a few hours taking a severe beating (especially if your battle party is surrounded by enemies ~ that's the definition of fun!) until you get the hang of it. Add to the fact the longer you take to enter a command, the more likely the enemy is going to boost and slap you around in the next turn. To add to this atrocity, add the fun of constantly stocking and boosting attacks in conjunction with airing and downing a opponent to cause any kind of reasonable damage. Then add to that fact not all characters can damage airborne opponents. Combat in Xenosaga I may have been a little basic and simplistic, but at least it was easy to pickup and learn, you almost need a degree (or a really good guide) to get anywhere in Xenoaga II. Oh, and don't get me started on the Mech or E.S. combat. While character combat is confusing to no end, E.S. combat is so pathetically simple it makes the gear combat in Xenogears look good in comparison.

As for side quests, add another point to the lame column. 35 sub quests helping complete strangers out of their stupid, insignificant daily problems they won't remember a week from now while the fate of the universe swings in the balance of your quest's success. Yeah sure, that sounds like fun as well. If I don't like to help complete strangers within the real world with their problems, what makes game developers think I want to do it in a video game? Come on!

Graphically, Xenosaga II is pretty much the same as the original, which makes me wonder why they hyped up that part of the game so much? Do they think gamers are so fixated on that lone aspect of a game, they are willing to forgive flaws in execution and gameplay? I mean, you can take the most graphically gorgeous game, and if the gameplay stinks, the game as whole suffers. Xenosaga II, as a game, proves this theory without a doubt.

As for sound or music, you actually better off turning the volume off, unless you're viewing a cut scene. Most of the music is pretty bad (a slim few interesting tracks do exist), and the voice acting is decent, outside battle that is. In battle, the voices make you cringe, where talking ""Star Ocean: The 2nd Story"" sound bite territory here. MOMO has to be the worst, the first time you hear her say ""I'll lend support"" you just want reach though the TV screen, or hope she reaches puberty before the series is over.

On the plus side (yes, their is a plus side ~ surprisingly) Xenosaga II's story continues on the rich tale from the first game, even if it seems a little touch and go, and they seem to focus too long on certain characters (the first disc is basically Jr. and MOMO centered); the second disc plays like ""hey, we forgot about the core of the story, let's go find the Zohar"".

The bottom line, if you like the story, you should play Xenosaga II, despite all it shortcomings. Actually, I'd recommend renting the game instead of buying it, it's short enough, and it'll teach the developers a very meaningful lesson. If this game becomes a greatest hit, like the original, I'd be very suprised (but it probably will just because I said that).",Namco's got guts releasing a mediocre game after the hype,1117065600,7,,

I understand that the control scheme takes some getting used to.  I have practiced and I am actually pretty good at the game now.  But the combos are ungodly slow.  There is no fluidity to the striking whatsoever.  Every attack has a delay and nothing feels organic about it at all.

The moves are all the same for every fighter, which makes no sense.  There is no differentiation  between fighters, other than the way they look.

Knockouts suck.  I hate to say it, but they do.
Rarely do you see a guy get knocked/rocked out and the other fighter just stands there.  They would always go in for the finishing blow, unless the ref stopped them and sometimes even if the ref was trying to stop them.  Not in this game, they just stand there and you are not allowed to do anything extra to ensure victory.  This is not realistic and takes away from the fun factor.

Don't these developers know that we like going in for the extras shots?  That is what made Fight Night such an awesome game.  You could knock the guy out against the ropes and keep punishing him until his body actually hit the floor.  How hard is to understand that we want to see this new damage system that actually shows the shots these fighters take?  Instead they give us a cut scene of us celebrating.  STUPID MOVE.

The racing in Need for speed was a lot of fun. It is pretty easy to get in and win some races. Also the graphics are top notch and game does look amazing. The cars the game has in it have great detail, plus some pretty cool but limited things to customize. The story is decent enough and cut scenes do look nice, as they are filmed like a movie with real people.

Now my issues with the game would make me for sure not purchase it. I was 100% going to buy this ahead of time but lucky me I have the EA Pass and was able to do the 10 hour trail. After the trail I have changed my mind and decided to save my money.

Starting off, this game requires it to always be online when playing. I find this funny as there is pretty much zero multiplayer unless you are playing with friends who also have the game. Just like the last Need for Speed title, it is a single player game that happens to have other random players driving around the huge open world, so occasionally you might see one drive by you. There is no option to jump into a game room with your customized car and do sprint races or anything else with random people. The story mode is fine but the actual acting is painful to watch with the words bae, dope, monster energy drinks at every turn, and just making the race community look like idiots.

My other issue is that apparently you have loads of customization options.. NOT TRUE! My second vehicle purchase I found this out. I was not able to change the hood, front or rear bumpers, grill, or even side skirts. I was left with one body kit, a spoiler and rims, oh and side fenders. Each area you can change has maybe 2 options such as if the car has the option to change a front bumper, you will have two to choose from.  Also the car selection is something around 30 cars if I am not mistaken. I would be fine with the small car selection if I was actually able to fully customize the cars in all aspects rather than a very select few.

This was a game I really did wish I liked. This is a fun racing game but again, if you were wanting a game like the older underground series or even Carbon, you will be disappointed. With the lack of any multiplayer, very little customization compared to older underground/carbon games, and annoying acting with too much product placement, this game gets a sad two stars from me.

2.0,False,"11 12, 2012",AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B002ADD6WO,Aiex Halo,"I am brand new to this style of strategy game; I stared in abject horror at the huge list of tutorials for Victoria 2 and Europa Universalis III, and it took me months just to begin to get a handle of the game's demands.  But once I did, I decided to turn to this one, since it covered the ancient world I loved.

Primarily, first and foremost, most importantly, etcetera, the game suffers from seemingly random crashes that utterly ruin the game for me; some 20 years into my campaign, it will freeze at the exact same date, and no amount of prior saves will fix this problem, so any other complaints are largely superfluous to a positive gaming experience compared to this.

Next, to the superfluous details:

It would make sense for this to have less adaptive/selection features than Europa Universalis III, to reflect a more primitive form of government (be it the monarchies of the Hellenistic Kingdoms, or the Republics of Rome and Carthage), but it becomes a severe deficiency when Rome in 200 BC has no access to horses anywhere in Italy, and is totally unable to research technologies to enable higher forms of infantry/cavalry, or boost research speed in particular fields (Army, Navy, Government, Stability, etc) and just hope that the game will randomly decide to grant you access to better military units.  It was stunning how I was unable to build ANYTHING at the start of my campaign because NOTHING was researched yet---even temples, of which Rome had many by 280 BC (when the game lets you start), are unavailable anywhere, and if some random event destroys your only temple in Rome, you cannot rebuild it for years and years until the ""technology"" is randomly granted to you.

As well, the military aspect.  Given the time period of this game, a nation's military virtually encompassed the nation's attention; there were no standards of civility by which a nation would surrender with honor to another, and especially with Rome, which would annex any lands that couldn't resist or offer a good reason not to.  Despite this, no extra attention or emphasis is given to the military in this game compared to EU3.

Worse, there is LESS emphasis---you cannot adjust your military/naval prestige or attention, and there's essentially NOTHING to distinguish the military capacities of different nations (ie, Rome having lightly trained, but zealous legionaries, Carthage having expensive veteran mercenaries, the Hellenistic Kingdoms having a solid, steadfast professional army).

This means it is the NORM for a Roman army of 20,000 Principes (because there are no Hastati or Triarii available) to lose FOUR OR FIVE TIMES IN A ROW to a Gallic Barbarian army of 4,000 or less.  Anyone with even a token knowledge of the Roman military would know that the EXACT OPPOSITE is true throughout virtually all of Roman history; the average Roman soldier was much better trained, better equipped, and better led than the average ""barbarian"" of virtually any of the ""barbarian"" tribes; Scythian, Gallic, German, Persian, African, Asian, etcetera.

This leads directly to another complaint; barbarians.  Unlike EU3 where you could risk colonization of any province regardless of its natives, here, it is IMPOSSIBLE to colonize ANY land if the barbarians are considered ""too strong"", and the barbarians are ALWAYS ""too strong"", without fail.  Rather than being able to invade with an actual army, the only solution for this is to basically lure the barbarians out by recruiting a single unit of military forces, and waiting months and months for the barbarians to rise up, kill them, and sack one of your settlements.

From there, the barbarian mechanic just goes completely off the edge; barbarians rise up in random numbers, and if the initial rise isn't quickly quashed by a nearby army, more and more of them spawn out of nowhere, or rise up from completely different provinces.  Combined with their anachronistic ability to easily crush a Roman army 10 times their size, and any attempts at colonization without two fully stacked armies nearby will pretty much end your game in total defeat.

As well, little consideration seems to be given in the historical bookmark dates.  Despite letting you start the game at major points between 280 BC and 27 BC, the game doesn't seem to care much to consider the actual political/military factors in place during these times.  For example; starting as Epirus in 280 BC will place you with your army in Epirus, and NO fleet available to you, meaning you have to wait a full year or more just to transport your army across the little gulf between Tarentum and Epirus.  Similarly, starting as Rome in 218 BC will see Carthage start with a full navy bigger than yours---despite the fact that one of the terms of the First Punic War was that Carthage's navy was severely limited by Rome, which would subsequently use its navy to prevent Carthage from doing anything to hurt Rome, hence the whole reason for Hannibal's marching through Gaul and over the Alps.  Here, he didn't need to do that; Carthage's navy easily quashed mine, then invaded Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica within a single year.

Apparently new to the game via the ""Vae Victis"" expansion is the implementation of the new and advanced Senate feature.  A better case for a tyranny I have never seen in any video game set in ancient Rome.  The two major Republics are Rome and Carthage, and virtually nothing is done to differentiate the two---there is only one Consul/one Shofet per year (historically there were two; this was a very big deal to exclude in this game), and you can appoint two Censors (or Elders for the Carthaginians) who appear to do absolutely nothing.  Laws passed by the Carthaginian Republic inexplicably have Roman names (Lex Cornelia, etcetera).

Historically, the Roman armies were commanded by the Consuls for the year.  In this game, there is absolutely no attempt to replicate this chaotic situation at all; there is no automatic-installation of the Consul to your biggest army, nor any indication that they should assume command as per their station, and given the abysmal loyalty that seems default amongst the prominent Senators, forcing an army commander to resign after a single year will guarantee that they revolt against you.

The ""party"" system is simplified, with there basically being only five or six major parties (Military, Populist, Religious, Mercantile, Civic, etcetera), with the only defining marks being that the Populists are the most evil, self-destructive party in the entire game.  Their primary features when in power is INCREASING your risk of revolts and DECREASING your stability.  How in the hell this makes any sense is entirely lost to me, and I have never seen more revolutions over a 50 year period as Rome since the Crisis of the Third Century AD in real life history.  It's beyond belief that this sort of game mechanic would be considered anything short of a colossal screw-up.

As well, Senate-based pop-ups seemed solely designed to ruin your life as much as possible.  There was indeed great political maneuvering amongst members of the Senate to gain power, but the effects that occur in game are exaggerated to such a degree that the relatively stable political environment of the mid-Republic looks more like the Civil Wars of Caesar and Pompey; the Senate DEMANDS you install Lucius Diddlypuss as governor of Magna Graecia, you accept, he's IMMEDIATELY A REBELLIOUS LITTLE TWIT CONSIDERING INDEPENDENCE.  NO EXCEPTION.  If you don't waste money bribing him or waste titles appointing him an Augur or a Pontifex, he will revolt, guaranteed.

These frustrations are disastrous in combination with each other, and make the game entirely unplayable due to the game's propensity to random crashing with no discernable solution.",Vastly inferior to EU3,1352678400,10,"{'Edition:': ' Gold', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

So I would not know where exactly to place the blame, Sid Meyer or 2K GAMES. But in the end, it does not matter. Because it is simply sad to see a great gaming franchise came to this.

THIS IS NOT A CIVILIZATION GAME
A great number of major features of this beloved series have been simply removed. A fellow gamer called this ""Civilization For Dummies"" and he is absolutely right.
There is no trading maps or technologies. There is no claiming resources outside your borders by building a colony. There is no need for transport ships as units apparently are now all..amphibious (and they need 15-20 turns to cross an ocean!). There are no city-growth milestone requirements (granary, aqueduct, refrigeration). There is no culturally conquering an enemy city (detonating a ""culture bomb"" by consuming a Great Artist will only get you extra territory tiles but no cities). There are no spies nor health/pollution balance. And there are no armies (please read on).

ARMY CASTRATION
Someone please tell me what was so wrong with armies that had to be yanked out? Napoleon almost conquered Europe with one army. Germany almost conquered the eastern hemisphere with three and the US still holds a two-and-a-half armies doctrine. How can a turn-based game be called Civilization unless one can emulate, well, a real civilization? Building an army, seasoning it on minor conflicts and then going for the enemy's capital was one of the most fun parts of any Civilization game. Why Sid, why?

YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LAUNCH INTO SPACE YET CANNOT CLIMB MOUNTAINS?!
Movement should be hindered by rough terrain. Units that have 3 or 4 moves on the plains should not be expected to do more than 1 or 2 on a mountain, right? Well, no. Mountains seem to be those magical places no unit can climb or pass through (not even ...helicopters of jet fighters!). And I cannot see how this makes for more complicated strategic decisions than timing your movements, claiming the high ground and having a bonus for elevated artillery?

UNIT STAMPEDE
A major issue for me, this was what really ruined the game. For some unfathomable reason units cannot be stacked. A worker can coexist with a military unit but that's it. Artillery and shock-cavalry are very vulnerable to attacks and (with the new hexagon layout) one would need ...six defensive units to protect a single artillery battery.
As a result, units keep getting on each other's way (especially when ordered to move for distances that require more than a turn), they refuse to even pass through friendly units (!) and the ""tactical"" considerations that result from this are trivial. And whenever besieging an enemy city, one has to endlessly maneuver his units around it (while exposed to its bombardment) whereas wounded units are never easy to withdraw.
You cannot even garrison more than a single unit within a city. Not that it would make a difference, since the garrisoned unit is not automatically awaken to fight back when the city is under attack(!), the city is left to defend itself.

CAN YOU REALLY COMMAND WITHOUT A...CENTRAL COMMAND?
The economy is nose-diving into the red and you want to reduce the percentage going into research for a while to avoid having units of yours deleted one by one? The fickle people of your civilization are unhappy and you want to placate them by increasing their entertainment allocation? You have discovered conscription and you want to upgrade all your musketeers into recruits? Well, TOUGH LUCK! There is not central command screen to do so. Only advisers that you have to thank for annoying you.
You have zero control of both your cities resource distribution and your national economy. And units have to be hunted down and upgraded one by one.
Speaking of the economy, when are going to see a Civilization game where one can run and manage a national debt?

NO FREE EYE-CANDY IN THIS UNIVERSE. NOT EVEN A STALE ONE.
The game does look new and polished and the units are well designed but not cutting edge and not without a steep hardware price. If you expect anything comparable to STARCRAFT II crispiness you will be disappointed - at my 1280x1024 resolution it is not easy to discern roads from railroads.
The system I am running my copy was top of the line about a year ago and still I had to tweak the video settings with a mix of high and medium to get it running. Even then, whenever I scroll to a different location of the map, I can see the image fleshing out, just like zooming in a Google-Earth map.
So one can only wonder: why should one need a...Cray to run a Civilization game at full?

STEAM OF WAR
The game requires OnLine Activation (and rumored perpetual reactivation every few days) and has to be tied to a STEAM account. Effectively this means that the game is a piece of rentware the buyer never really owns and yet it is sold at full price. I realize that to some people this may not be a serious issue so, in case you are wondering, I deducted a single star from my overall rating of the game because of its DRM scheme. To every other gamer however, you can now make an informed decision.

This was a major disappointment. I never though I'd say this but I while playing the latest Civilization game I caught myself wondering if they would ever make...CALL TO POWER III.

New gamers, steer clear of this mess, this is NOT what a Civilization game plays like.

The developers stayed true to the style and look of past silent hill games, which is great. The graphics were up to standards with the series as well. Actually, just about everything was except for the gameplay. To put it simply, the game is way too hard. All it takes is one enemy to kill you almost instantly. When the enemies attack you, you are stunned and unable to defend yourself. As your stunned, they continue to attack you until you until your health runs out and you die. So basically, once an enemy starts attacking you (mainly the nurses) there's no escape. What makes this even more frustrating are the checkpoints, or lack thereof. The checkpoints are way to far in between. You will find yourself running tasks, errands and fighting through the same enemies multiple times until you get the the next one.

Its a shame this game turned out that bad, I was really looking forward to it.

I played the game for 3 hours and just got frustated. I am pretty good at street fighter but Zangief is a cheat on this game he endures attacks and then grabs you repeatedly and its hard to stop.

I repeat this game is a rip-off and you are better off getting TEKKEN, marvel vs capcom 2 or any other street fighter from the ps one series, any tekken will do excluding 1 and 4.

Halo 4 is just a plain first person shooter game with myriads of small enemy combatants that come at you in groups. The problem with this, is that you are only allowed so much ammo with the particular rifle you have and the limited 4 grenades you can carry. When you run  out of ammo you are a dead duck. Even if you skillfully use your ammo resourcefully, and manage to kill two groups, there will be another large group of enemies soon to be right around the corner and you will run out of ammo. All you are doing in this game is shooting,shooting,shooting. It gets old quick.

  Graphics are not sharp and clear in the Xbox360 either. I play my XBox 360 on a new 1080 HD TV. The Mass Effect game series were far more sharp and clear than this sub par shooter game. This game has no real storyline and you really have no squad to help you. Whats worse is trying to find any ammo packs laying around. All you can hope for is finding a rifle on a wall somewhere. But that is pretty hard to do when the enemy is blasting away at you constantly.

  Also, no PRINTED game manual came with the game either. So you are stuck on just looking for the controller layout key buttons and hope for the best. The little electric phaser pistols are worthless against the enemy and most of the enemy have round shield protection anyway. You will eventually throw your hands up in frustration trying to play this game yourself. If you have a friend to play with you you probably will do much better.

2.0,True,"09 8, 2015",A39NKHXOOY2AKM,B00MSOEWQY,Johnny Devil,"This is an expensive headset. I expected to notice an immediate difference between these babies and my Turtle Beach XO Ones, and they were different all right -- I just didn't expect to prefer my $60 XO Ones to this premium setup.

I'll qualify this review with two things: 1) I am an Xbox One user. This headset quite likely behaves differently on a PC and I cannot speak to that. 2) I do not have a mixamp. I used this headset with an Xbox One stereo adapter.

Now that that's out of the way, let's get to what I didn't like about the Siberia Elite Prism. A major factor for me is that there is no mic monitoring, meaning that you can't hear yourself speak through the headset. Some people might prefer this, but I find that it makes it impossible to gauge how loudly I am speaking to my friends. I prefer to hear all chat sounds -- my own included -- equally. NOTE: if you're upgrading from a cheaper Turtle Beach headset to these, plug the Siberia's into the TB base instead of into the Xbox One stereo connector, and poof, you get mic monitoring. Still didn't sell me on them though. They don't get a star back for that either, since in order to take advantage of it you need an adapter from another company.

Beyond the mic monitoring, I found the ear cups to be uncomfortably and disproportionately large. And they're spring-loaded, so it was difficult to get them to stay in a comfortable position. I also didn't like the retractable mic feature; in order to make that work, the mic has to be made of a pretty flexible (read: flimsy) material that feels cheap and not durable. No points there.

The sound quality on these was, however, very good. Nice deep bass, even mids and treble. Can't fault Siberia there. The overall construction was also solid. With the exception of the removable mic I had no doubts about this product having a long life.

In the end though, I can't recommend these over cheaper headsets. There just isn't enough draw (for a console gamer at least) to justify the price. We certainly aren't going to be taking advantage of the programmable LEDs. I ended up returning these and and then investing roughly half of my refund into a pair of HyperX Clouds, which I dearly love.

If you are considering this for the PC, read the above thread first.  This is a terrible port.  The graphics might be great, the story might be good (I don't know this to be true) but the UI and controls are abysmal on the PC.  If you were expecting the series to return to the direction of DAO, this game does not.  If you were looking forward to the tactical camera, you will be disappointed.  If you expected them to put in any effort at all to distinguish the PC version from the console versions in terms of controls or UI, they didn't.

If you don't mind DAI being an action RPG, go for it, probably not the worst $60 you can spend.  I would get a console version though, if you have any PC gamer roots at all because this game will disappoint you just in terms of what could have been.

2.0,False,"08 12, 2016",A2ORZYOH2IRT9W,B0111WVVLM,Jason Dodge,"Is this the Sega answer to the NES Classic Edition with 30 games and HDMI? No, it's a repackage of a product that's been sold since 2009 in North America. AtGames is a Chinese company, though you won't find it mentioned anywhere on there website. But it becomes apparent when you see how little information is given in English on their products. AtGames has been manufacturing a product that plays Sega Genesis cartridges since 2003 as far as I can tell, starting overseas, gaining an official Sega license along the way (around 2007 or so), and then they brought it over for a official launch in North America (though you could find them since 2009 in different forms). You'll see this same hardware called different names over the years (the Mega X-3, the Firecore system), but 2012 was the first time that AtGames actually made more of a marketing push and started using somewhat professional packaging, including the Sega Genesis logo and a few actual game characters. They also have separate Genesis and Master System handheld portable systems they've been selling since about 2011. For 2016 they redesigned the packaging again (though its labeled as the 2015 version), and are hoping you pick one up when you're looking for that NES Classic Edition console. Each year the games that were included got slight revisions, like for 2016 we got the three Mortal Kombat games (along with a few others), but the low-quality controllers and console itself really haven't changed year to year.

THE PRODUCT: It may say ""80-90 Games"" on the packaging, but this is misleading, as you typically only get 40 Genesis game, and 40+ self-published titles that could best be described as homebrew games (think of the contents of Action 52 and you'll understand). The biggest complaint gamers have is that the EMULATION IS ONLY 90-95%! This is your standard console-on-a-chip, and you'll find the sound is often presented at the wrong hertz (listen to the Sonic the Hedgehog start-up music and any long-time fans will spot the ""off-key"" music, as it is sometimes called). Sonic himself also doesn't quite reach the speeds he normally does, though it's close. Colors can often be off in areas as well. Some people may not notice these little differences, but for the hardcore its a deal-breaker. AtGames has only made slight changes over the years with its emulation, so it probably won't get noticeably better any time soon. It really is the same unit in the box for the last several years, despite what they show.

The console itself only offers MONO SOUND, but the game slot is big enough to accept ALL North American, European and Japanese games, so this unit is REGION FREE. This unit has NEVER had an HDMI port on it. Your standard composite A/V cables are your only option for video. There were some units that had an SD slot in 2012, which means you could take a 2GB or 4GB SD Card and put all the Genesis/MegaDrive games you want and play them. But over the last year or so I'm not sure if they still manufacture this version, so be aware. Definitely a nice feature if you find it, but you'll need to convert them to the .bin format, and put them in a folder marked ""games"" or it won't work. There should be some more detailed instructions on the internet for those that need them.

NO SAVE FEATURE: The next biggest complaint is the complete lack of a save feature, even if you have your games on an SD Card. AtGames NEVER discloses this information on any of its products, but you should know it ahead of time (the website may have been updated, but the packaging itself never indicates it). Unless someone knows for certain they have one that does, but I doubt it. All previous versions don't let you save. For a lot of games this really doesn't matter, but it means that any game that featured a battery back-up needs to be finished in one sitting (namely RPGs, like Phantasy Star 2). And even if you put in the real physical cartridge to a game that has a working battery back-up -- the save feature STILL WONT WORK. It seems that only an original Genesis/MegaDrive console and the Retron 3 system will actually save your progress to the cartridge. If you come back to one of these games, only the saves that were previously made will be present, regardless of the progress you made, and even if the system says the save was successful. Games that use passwords are obviously unaffected.

BOTTOM LINE:
The more casual gamers may not mind the negatives. This console has many of the same limitations as the Genesis 3: you can't use a Game Genie, Sonic & Knuckles won't recognize the game you plug on top of it, and some other games just won't work. Be sure that the unit you get still has controller ports because the packages that include a couple of wireless controllers have many problems. They use Infrared light and many people have reported problems with button delays, especially when using both at the same time. The slight sound and graphical deviations may not be noticed as much if you haven't played many of these games in nearly 20 years, and not being able to save may not be a big deal since many games don't require it anyway, and those that offer a password feature can still be played like normal. Its also very nice to have a simple Genesis-clone with the ability to plug in any official Genesis controllers, and a way to take the entire Genesis/MegaDrive collection on a SD Card if you wish (if able). Perfect for some nostalgic gaming if you're on the go, or you need to be away from your main gamming collection for a few days. Just throw this thing in your backpack and you're all set. The list price is often $60, but you should still find it for around $40 new at Walgren's, Family Dollar and SafeRite stores. Be wary of those $100 prices.

The more hardcore gamers will hate the quality of the emulation, having the sound being off so much will make it impossible to play for some, not to mention some areas will have the wrong-color sprites, and some games just plain won't work. The emulation doesn't include Sega CD / Mega CD or the 32X compatibility, you can't save in-game, and you can't even use the emulator itself to create save-states. Having mono-sound is also a bummer. The price may be attractive, but there's a reason why the big retailers don't carry the product. Its a cheaply manufactured product meant to be sold in Third-World countries alongside other knock-off products. The official Sega license is nice, but many of the games are the same as on ""Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection"" (PS3, Xbox360), so just get that. Nowadays you're probably better off bringing your laptop with you, complete with a decent Genesis emulator, a collection of ROMs, and a digital controller so you don't need to use the keyboard to play. You won't have a cartridge slot, but it will be more authentic.","Casual Gamers may Like It, but Hardcore Gamers Will Hate It",1470960000,,,

There are four different levels of training: weight loss, intervals, strength training, and hill climb. Users are allowed to set their own length time for each session and the intensity you'd like to train. This allows you to string together a comprehensive workout, unlike Wii Fit.

The actual volleyball part of the game is When I hear the title ""XTREME"" Volleyball, I want solid gameplay, but you get none of that. And what makes it extreme anyway? Sure the bodacious babes are a big plus, but the gameplay relies on just hittin the ball over the net with 2 buttons and hoping you get points. I just felt the lack of interaction. Heck, Tecmo didnt' even bother to apply the scoring rules to this volleyball game.  Only A and B buttons are used.  There are basically only 2 things you can do on offense, hit the ball up in the air for your partner, then spike it over the net. Fun? Um, not hardly. The computer basically decides the matches and who wins. There is no strategy involved, it's just game for looks and busty babes, nothing more. This is Tecmo, the makers of Ninja Gaiden and DOA Hardcore? Anyway, then after a boring day playing volleyball, you have to go back to the lame Island mode and waste time going through useless and boring places on the island. You try to earn the love of other girls by buying them swimsuits and gifts. Why would one find this enticing?  I'm sorry, this game sucks. Sounds like a harsh description, but if it wasn't the redeeming factor of the sweet graphics, this game would be a total disappointment.  Is it the worst volleyball game ever? No. But when you pit it against the quality of Sega's game on the Cube, it's just further proof how bad the volleyball engine really is.

The graphics are amazing though. The ladies look better than ever and if they were real I'd defintely want a few dates. It's actually the same engine Tecmo used in Dead Or Alive 3 for the XBOX. You'll recognize one of the beaches being taken directly from the 3, and it looks amazing. Seagulls flying in the background, warm sand curdling your girls feet, and the ocean hitting the sand over the horizon. There are also new beaches, jungles and islands to play volleyball. Once again, lush scenery, fantastic animations and great graphics are nice, but when the gameplay sucks, who cares? For the guys that bought the game strictly for the babes, they might appreciate the ""Gravure System"" as Tecmo calls it. On days when you want to be alone with your girl, you can take her somewhere alone on the island and just look at her basking in the morning sun. You're thoughts of being there with her might be fun for awhile and mind you it is ultra realistic. You can zoom in on her, change the camera view and take her to different locations. For added visuals, you can also give your girl a nice tan and hook her up with countless bikinis. You can buy tanning oil in the accessory shop and you can watch them over time get a lush golden tan from the sun. If you want to keep them healthy, you can also buy sun block. Sigh. This sucks.

I have played and beaten the prequel thoroughly, even getting the extra ending for finding all the Precursor Orbs. I loved the game from one end to the other.

When Jak 2 opens, it's clear that the story will be taking a new turn into a dark place:  our heroes are in a bad future, and we take control of Jak only after an interval (told through cutscenes) of his having been tortured and mutated.  It seemed to make for an interesting new take on the series, but very quickly you realize that unlike its predecessor, Jak II imitates more than it innovates.  Even worse, the imitation isn't even in the same genre:  Jak 2 dovetails its platformer formula into a more ""sandboxed"" open world that heavily mimics the Grand Theft Auto series.  I've played the GTA series and loved it, but here the fusion fails miserably.  As the storyline progresses, frustrating side quests and attempts to inject variety into the gameplay are quickly derailed by the fact that a single mistake blows the entire operation, bumping into someone during a race can trigger a full alert, and you can easily get shot out of the sky, have your vehicle explode out from under you, or find yourself surrounded by a never-ending stream of guards.

I'd like to say the awfulness ends there, but unfortunately the amount of effort quickly outweighs the payoff.  There are times when ""puzzles"" amount to ""how often can you kill/smash things before you're caught and killed?""  In more than one sequence, you become convinced that Jack Thompson has finally found his ""murder simulator"":  the goal is to bang on the trigger, again and again, as fast as you can, while guards die screaming at your feet.  The difficulty is balanced by a bonus ""Dark Jak"" feature that makes you super-powerful. However this feature gets seriously annoying: it takes a lot of dark eco collecting to charge it up, and during these murder-fest stretches, it's all too easy to accidentally bang the lower trigger and blow your charge.  If you plan to use this power burst to get yourself through a difficult spot, if you don't survive to the checkpoint, you won't have it available to you again because there won't be enough Dark Eco lying around to recharge you.

Where I finally gave up on this game--at the 94% mark--was when the number of pointless conveyor belts with hard-to-reach switches over boiling lava and/or radiation pits made me realize that this was no longer ""challenging"", it was more like a test to see how angry the player could get before they take the disc out and throw it against the wall.

This is another beat-up-the-bad-guys-and-save-the-girl video game from the makers of. . . actually Technos made this game. I know next to nothing about Technos. Double Dragon is a game of three distinct trigger actions: jumping, punching, and kicking; and seeing as how the standard NES controller has only two trigger buttons, Tehcnos decided in part 3 (as with the previous games) to make jumping accessible by through pressing the both the punch and kick buttons simultaneously (there is lenience so both buttons do not need to be pressed at the exact same time). From a jump, you can perform one of three attacks as Billy or Jimmy: cyclone spin-kick (A or B), arial kick (left or right and B), or monkey-flip your opponent (left or right and A). When monkey-flipping your opponent, you somersaut over your opponent, grab his/her head or hair, and toss him/her through the air. This is especially fun when fighting on ledges -- just make sure you don't get too close and fall off, yourself.
On the downside, there are no playable females (which seems to bother only myself). You can still fight against a few female thugs though.
Another hex is the high level of difficulty that stems from the questionable play-control. For example, the first boss (who somehwat resembles the Jack of Hearts) has a long reach which makes him hard to hit and he often ducks when you try to whack him with your cyclone spin-kick, leaving you open for attack, thanks to a lagging recovery. You also cannot monkey-flip some enemies.
As for Chin and Ranzou, these two have slightly different attack methods from the Double Dragons:
Chin has a diving Kamikaze head-butt which is activated through jumping towards your an enemy and then pressing A. When your press A or B after jumping, he does some weird air dance that only attacks from one side. His weapon is the iron claw, similar to Vega from Street Fighter.
Yagu Ranzou is (in my opinion) the best character. He uses a katana instead of his bare fists and he can use his other weapon 20 times (as opposed to Chin and the Lee brothers who can only use their's five). Ranzou's weapon is the shuriken (or flying ninja star).
You can play as Chin and Ranzou only after you have beaten them.
Billy and Jimmy's weapons are the nunchukues.

When I read such positive reviews about such an uninspiring game, I thought of the old horror flick Halloween III.  Get the picture?  If you don't, simply watch H_3, and you'll come to understand.

Now about the game itself.  Animal Crossing was a marketing success, but a nightmare behind closed doors for those who felt definite disappointment in the overall release.  Of course the majority of those who own Animal Crossing may feel a bit different.  Those of us who were looking for something more, were surely left in the dark.  Animal Crossing COULD have been a GREAT game.  Instead, it was released with stone age graphics, very limited real life concepts and nothing to offer for the more mature gaming community.

Not all of Animal Crossing is terrible.  The real time concept was unique and impressive.  Anything else brought into the same light would be considered a joke.  Many would like to put TheSims and Animal Crossing in the same boat, but the two really can't be compared.  TheSims has endless possibilities, while Animal Crossing is extremely limited.

Shortly before it's release we found out the truth: not canon at all. This was disapointing, but I thought the game might have some fun in it for fans of the show, so I picked it up. This was a poor move on my part, as the game really isn't that much fun.

The player runs around the island, but in the most narrow sense. Each area is small, and the player's movements are restricted. Don't think you can wander around and spot the 4 toed statue, because you can't. In fact, all you can really do is go from the beach to a generic jungle setting, to a cave or the hatch. There aren't too many secrets around, and you'll most certainly find all of them without looking too hard.

The plot in the game is pretty bad. You've got tasks in front of you, but really no motivation to complete them (other than that's what next in the game). The characters are all hatable, even the ones you usually like in show. To make matters worse, the ending of the game is terrible as well.

This game is not the authentic real life war on-the-battlefield war game that all the geeks are hyping and signing the party line the company puts out.

I bought two of these games after reading the reviews and I have to say that you people don't know what you are talking about.

There is pseudo-realism and that is about it. Sure the maps are close, the look and sounds of the weapons are close and even the dialog is about right, but that is about as far as it goes.

These games fall down severely on the accuracy/authenticity in several key areas.

1. Ludicrous restriction on the tactical options available to the soldiers and the squad leaders. Some of this is bad level design, some of it is probably trying to make up for the limitations of their AI, and some of it is just plain dumb.

2. Ridiculous limitations on interaction with the environments. You cannot open doors or windows. You cannot climb fences. You cannot use the wire cutters that every paratroop carried. You cannot go under a normal barbed wire fence, which thousands of hunters do several times a day in america.

Barrels and crates don't blow up or even move when hit by a tank. You can't even climb over a low wall that some other men just went over.

Perhaps most unforgivable of all, you cannot go into a prone position or crawl. You know, the stuff they teach everyone in BASIC TRAINING!

3. The gunsights are ludicrous. The amount of creep even in a crouching position is ridiculous. If I was that shakey I'd head for the retirement home.

4. Terrible path blocking and object collision detection. Quite a few times when I had a perfect view of a target and as perfect a sight picture as you would ever want I could not hit the target no matter how many rounds I fired. In real life I would have put a round through both ears of my target.

5. Absurd size of the weapons relative to your field of vision when zoomed in. Come on folks this is ridiculously UN-authentic. There is a reason for the open sights on fast action weapons like the Thompson and other SMG weapons.

6. Really stupid scenario designs. There are several instances where you are put face to face with tanks and no tactical options except to run for enemy panzerfausts. Making this worse of course are the level designs that force you to follow a relatively linear and restricted path to said anti-tank weapons. This is completely ridiculous.

7. Poor level designs. Too many places you cannot go or step when you should be able to. Places you cannot jump over or crawl under where you should. Only in EIB do you get to even blow holes in the hedges with the TNT that all paratroops carried as part of their standard pack during that theater of operations, and then only in key places and one whole scenario.

8. Situational awareness mode. Give me a break. This is supposed to substitute for the advance study done by the troops? It's not even as good as a raw topo map dump. You are chained to camera angles around key points and there are no indications of any significant type for changes in elevation and quite often the terrain features are faded out due to the choices made for the camera angle.

9. Another limiting factor is that you cannot issue movement commands to a  location you know is there but are not lined up on directly yourself and you had better be on the side away from the enemy when you issue the order. This could have been easily fixed by using some option to issue commands while in situational mode, especially if that were better done.

10. Lastly the much hyped authentic tactics. Authentic, sure, in a very introductory and watered down way, severely limited in permutations, applications and variations due to all the other limitations of the game.

By the way, I am both a veteran and an experienced programmer and I am highly disappointed with this game on both counts.

If this is the latest in realism then it shows what a sorry state the gaming industry really is in. Of course I still haven't seen AI in a commercial game yet that matched up to what I saw undergrad programmers doing in college during the 80s. We deserve better and it's not that hard to do. It's time we stopped allowing these companies to hype this stuff up like it is so great when it's all fluff like pretty pictures and sound.

It was running hot but I didn't really notice it any cooler.

I then let the PS4 cool down completely and then set it up without the Cooler Vertical stand and ran it for 4 hours to compare.

I did the same exact thing with the machine, I played the same exact game -(Witcher 3).

It uses the same low-profile (laptop-like) keys that I was used to from the Lycosa, but simply lacks the back-lighting--I thought.  When I got it out of the box, however, I found that the keys themselves are very slippery/glossy and that i couldn't count on the same degree of control I'm accustomed to with the Lycosa.  More importantly, the key action was not as smooth as several of my Lycosas.  There is neither a satisfying ""click"" nor the pleasant absence of clicks that you find with a nice laptop keyboard or a Logitech model with low-profile keys.  What you have here is switches that feel a bit ""muddy"" and imprecise.

Add to that the lack of USB ports and backlighting and you get a keyboard that is just totally lackluster at this price-point.  Again, I've tried to love Razer products despite many disappointments with hardware QA on the Lycosas, but this is the last straw.  I'm writing this whole brand off as pure hype.  Way too much money goes into their marketing and way too little into the actual hardware.  I'm typing this now on a refurbished Lycosa that was sent as a replacement.  Some of the keys actually squeak, and if you don't depress them in a purely perpendicular motion, some of the keys actually rub or bind, making it really hard to trigger them.

So disappointing.  Please try another manufacturer!","Improved switches?  Improved profit margins, more like it!",1365292800,,{'Color:': ' Silver'},

At first I was really hesitant to get into the any Final Fantasy games. It just seemed too kiddy, the character design was fruity, it seemed like a mish-mash of fantasy / sci-fi that just clashed, and was filled with mellow drama (all the same reasons I don't like any current anime series). I tried 11 and gave up 25 hours in. Then I tried 12 which I played the h*ll out of. It was HUGE, had a top-notch story and cinematics, was very original, and really gave you way more than your money's worth. It was too much game for me, but I was happy not completing every little thing or getting fully leveled. So I played 13 and it surpassed my every expectation. The story and the way it's told was the best I've seen in a game, and rivals the best of fantasy / sci-fi movies. The characters were well developed, realistic, and extremely well voiced. The fully rendered cut scenes are the best out there and plentiful. In the current gaming world, where games are rushed and buggy, good designers are undervalued, good writing is none existent, and programmers are a dime a dozen, this game shows how good a game can be if you do it right. This is my personal favorite of the current generation.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: It throws you right into this awesome battle, I would have liked some explanation, but it was fun. I'm not a huge fan of quick time events, but the way they're done is good and adds to the action, spicing up the battle. The battle system's the same as 13 more or less. You unlock moves WAY quicker, which those of us who played 13, it gets you into the advanced tactics quick and makes the battles more fun. The live events (mostly dialogue choices) seem tacked on. If I want character-controlled dialogue, I'll play Mass Effect. They really should have put that effort into developing the main characters and story.

STORY: It seems odd they didn't just introduce a new Fal'Cie or L'cie, go from there. The story really seemed underdeveloped and not well thought out. The first 15 hours really lack any real plot or character development. The story that is there is seems more like a rough draft or after thought. The premise supports separate plot lines, but none of them really grab you or are well thought-out. Even the main story grabs you for hour or so only to leave you adrift for 10 hours, then grabs you again but going in some other direction. There plot points that seem they should be major that are given only a passing glance and themes that are belabored. The characters aren't well established and their development is sporadic. There are parts that are really great and get you going, but they are just too few and too thoughtlessly developed. This is where good character development could have picked up the slack but it seem that they just took the bun out of the oven a year too soon and you know it's not going back. What really added insult to injury was the to be continued ending. Really?

OVERALL: If this were any other title I'm sure I wouldn't be as critical. Final Fantasy has consistently set the bar extremely high. Of course, if this were any other title I wouldn't have pre-ordered it and most likely would have abandoned playing it 6 or 7 hours in due to the lack of compelling story. It's really the underdeveloped story and characters that bother me. I feel like this game took advantage of my love of 13 and I'll be extremely wary of any forth coming squaresoft game without at least a three year development time. I thought a sequel this quick was too good to be true and it was. That being said it is not an altogether unenjoyable play especially if you go in with no expectations. I tried my best keep an open mind. Now that I have beaten it (I didn't 100% it but I have ~120 fragments) I am purging my disappointment with this review.

Raillard,"Do you remember those incredibly cheap fighting game characters that would cause you to blow a gasket as they unleashed a 28-hit combo which you couldn't block or recover from?  Remember how M. Bison in Street Fighter 2 or Heihachi in Tekken 1 were so incredibly cheap and would barely let you get a hit in?  If that sounds like fun, then by all means buy Def Jam Fight for NY!  This game is actually fun for a while, and it looks and sounds great, but it's too bad that the control is so cheesy and unbalanced that it basically ruined the game for me.

PROS: Great graphics, awesome voice-over acting, tons of cool customization options (real licensed gear; you can get Air Jordans for your character!), an interesting story line, and tons of famous (and less famous) hip-hop celebrities.  This game has got style and character, without a doubt.

CONS: Unfortunately, the gameplay (you know, the actual point of the game, as opposed to buying jewelry and clothes for your fighter like some urban Barbie doll) is both too simple and too frustrating.  The main problem is that all fights follow the same exact progression: land a punch or kick, get your opponent dizzy, grapple them, throw them down, pick them up while they're still dizzy, repeat.  There are NO MOVES in this game.  Oh sure, you can buy a couple dozen ""blazin' moves"", but these can only be used once or twice (rarely twice) a fight, and only in certain circumstances.  The BIG weakness is that the computer AI is really cheap, and will basically string together about 25 moves before you can even move.  Blocking and countering are really, really weak and tough to pull off, and I actually had a fight (admittedly with an upper level character) where I couldn't land a hit, and any miss on my part would result in a 3 minute orgy of hits from the AI.  HHMMMMM... fun.  I guess you could sum up the problem by saying that there is really little strategy involved, and that you can't get all that much better.  The crowd and object interaction are also really poorly done, since the crowd is like a magnet: get too close to ANY spectator, and they'll hold you while the computer unleashes a 13 hit combo.  Does this ever happen to the CPU?  Rarely. Lastly, the arenas are well done, but you can't appreciate them because the camera stinks and half the time you can't see where your guy is!

When I first started the training mission, I got a look at the gameplay itself. The graphics aren't the best, but that is never enough to turn me away from a game. However, I couldn't get over the horrible looking face models of my soldiers. I don't mind the basicly square faces of the characters in Spiderman for the Playstation, yet I cringe whenever I see someones face in this game.

1) This has to be the worst of the worst: when you are hit, it takes 2-5 seconds to recover, during which time you cannot fight but will continue to take hits and damage from your enemies.  It doesn't matter how hard you hit any buttons.  Your character will spin for a few seconds and bleed away.  And get this: when you hit an enemy, he doesn't suffer from this problem!  So if you play this game, be prepared to die many unnecessary deaths.
2) While there's an impressive list of weapons in the game, many are very poorly implemented.  Get a machine gun or shot gun, and you'll find that you can't really aim accurately.  Sometimes... even when you aim and fire at the enemy, he doesn't suffer any damage!  I don't know if this is a bug, or just another way for some sadistic programmer to make a gamer's life miserable.
3) Enemies are strong.  As mentioned before, they don't get immobilized temporarily like your character does, and they are really tough...  I'm talking about the non-bosses!  And there's no difficulty option in this game.
4) Even though you can access the save screen at any time during the game, it doesn't really save the game at the point you think you are saving.  Instead, when you load the game, it starts from the beginning of the mission!  And what exactly constitutes a savable mission is also confusing.

It's a bad game. Initially, I had only watched a playthrough of the game, all the way through in one sitting. That was just fine. In fact, I enjoyed it. Think of it as a long movie that way. However, once I played it, it was very evident very quickly that it was going to be a tedious, painful experience.

[CONS]

The gameplay is the main killer here, for me. I don't mind story driven games, and as long as the other components of the game are up to par, then I'll most likely be enjoying the game. For Beyond: Two Souls, that is not the case. The gameplay kills the experience. Odd controls that aren't always the same, and combat in particular is very confusing. You're supposed to push the stick in the direction that Jodie is moving, but it isn't always so clear. Many of her limbs move in opposing directions or she is moving very slightly in slow motion that it's not detectable at all. But, you can't fail. There's no game over. That's just very poor and lazy game design. It's like a way of saying, ""we don't need to develop a comprehensive control scheme, because eventually they'll get it right."" Seriously.

Another issue is that of the story. I won't spoil anything, but it jumps around a lot. Years sometimes. I understand why, but it's done very poorly as well. They introduce new parts of the story in these parts, that if it were done chronologically, it WOULD make more sense, but it would introduce an idea or aspect of the ""lore"" that wouldn't be explored for a while down the line, just leaving it to simmer while people apparently would forget all about it.

Yet another problem this game exhibits is that the longest segment in the game, over an hour of a single chapter, is entirely unnecessary in my mind. It adds absolutely nothing to the story. That's not fair though, because what it tries to add, merely confuses people further. Is there magic in this particular world? It's not explored in depth enough to know. Essentially, it just gives an excuse for one of the final ""choices"" in the game.

That's another problem. In a very story driven game, you'd think that if the interaction is predetermined, there'd be at least branching pathways to take in it, right? Nope. Only in the last 10 minutes or so. You decide Jodie's ultimate fate; all choices can be reached no matter what ""choices"" you make in the game previously, through action or inaction, or dialogue. You might as well be nothing more than an observer in this ""game"". Dialogue choices are chosen automatically for you in about 5-20 seconds depending on the situation, and even some actions. I much preferred the experience of this game when it was someone else holding the controller. Perhaps that's the way it will be for you, too, so you'd be much better off watching a playthrough on YouTube of a commentator of your choice, or without commentary. Either has its benefits.

[PROS]

There are a few things that I do like about this game though, and why I decided to give it more than the minimum stars available. The graphics are phenomenal. Everything is acted out by a couple of high profile actors, Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe. Both offer outstanding performances. Though their characters can drift into and out of favor as well as character, the actors do their best to fill the roles with life and believably. It was clearly a labor of love for both the art and talent departments.

The story is quite intricate, and if you're able to piece things together, it can be appreciated how deep this game goes. The script was several thousand pages apparently. I think that the idea would have been served much, much better as a novel instead of the game. You notice many of its faults when it's an ""interactive"" product. There are many action sequences and interactions that are absolutely terrible and painful to watch with how lame or outrageous they are.

[Conclusion]

After playing it, I'm surprised that reviewers went as easy on it as they did. They mentioned the same problems that I did, but I guess it didn't bother them nearly as much. Overall, I have relatively mixed feelings about this game. I really, really don't recommend buying it, maybe a rental if you're curious. That's what I did. Beat it as fast as I could, about 8 hours, choosing interactions and sequences that I knew would reduce the playing time. I would just suggest watching it on YouTube. There's plenty of full playthroughs out there. If I hadn't played it, I would have given it close to 4 stars. That's not what you're here for though, you're here for the game experience, and I delivered, whether it's what you wanted or not. It's the cold, hard truth. It's a huge depart from Heavy Rain, and it's not a good one at that. Stay away if you're even curious enough to read the reviews. Heavy Rain would be largely recommended instead for a similar experience.","Not a good game, but a decent experience otherwise",1394496000,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

I found some difficulty with the controls.  While all games require an adjustment period to get used to the new controls, these are combersome no matter what.  To turn your character around you must actually walk him around in a circle, which can be quite difficult (and deadly) especially when getting attacked.  While other games have a rotate button for fighters in 3D environments, this does not.
Next I found the cut-scenes to be horrible.  Not that the voice acting or animation were bad at all, but rather that you can't skip over them with a press of a button.  Obviously if you're into a game, you'll want to watch a scene once to follow the story.  But it's just too much to take when you reach a difficult point in the game and get killed only to have to watch the same 5 minute cut-scene over and over again until you figure out how to beat the particular situation.
Lack of problem solving is another issue.  Why have a mature rated game with child level problem solving?  All problems are obvious and usually only take a couple of minutes to solve at the most.  The majority have a flashing beacon over the objective so you know exactly where you need to go and there's always only one very obvious solution to the problem.
Finally, the gameplay just gets old.  I suppose because the rest of the game is so annoying that you just get tired of dealing with the same old thing.  There are difficult controls that once mastered make it easy to beat all enemies.  Tiresome cut-scenes that seem to never end and problems that are all to easy to solve.  And let's not forget the animation that causes many enemies (and some much needed weapons) to fall halfway or all the way through walls and floors.  I was amazed to see that enemies will end up buried halfway into walls or stairs simply because that's where they landed rather than bouncing.  If I didn't know any better I would think that this game had been made 5 years ago.  This last problem is a programming error (or laziness) that there's simply no excuse for.
In the end, rent this game if you have to, but don't buy it.","Such Potential, Such Waste",1038787200,3,,

Well, I just finished it and I agree with the lower end of the reviews. I feel bad for this game because it could've been so much better but it ended up being a waste of talent. The acting and motion capture works really well but the story is just all over the place and gets to the point where is cheesy and full of cliches.

It was definitely an interesting experience but not worth buying or playing. The only reason I did is because I was really curious about the game and the story but I got to a point where I lost interest in the story and just played it because I had already payed for the game. I would tell you to buy it or even get it once the price goes down but the gameplay is so minimal and of no consequence that you'd be better watching in on YouTube. It's definitely fun to control Aiden but it gets old and boring after a while because your options are VERY limited. If you want to feel how it is to control Aiden just download the demo and that's all you need to know. It doesn't get any better than the demo, in fact, it gets worse.

The main thing hat bothered me is how boring and limiting the gameplay is. You're literally just watching and doing pointless and dumb things like choosing which side of the bed you want to sleep in order to advance the story and feel like you're ""playing"". In the demo you'll play the most interesting and exciting parts of the game.

-----SMALL SPOILERS ABOUT THE GENRE OF THE GAME-------

I feel kind of cheated because the game was marketed as something else and they purposely hid what this was really about because they knew people wouldn't buy it. You go in thinking you're going to get some cool story about a girl and a ghost but in the end what you get is ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"". I don't want to spoil anything but I feel an obligation to inform you about what the genre of the game is. It's not aliens but it's as silly as cheesy as aliens. Instead of aliens you have ghosts and ""infra-world"" crap. ""Beyond"" gets a little to silly for my taste. I guess if you liked ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"" you'll like this game but if you didn't like that movie because it was too dumb then this is not for you.

As some review I read said, ""if this was a move it would be a VERY bad one"" and I agree. I've lost all hope in David Cage and I wouldn't mind if they stopped making games exclusives for PlayStation.

----SOMEWHAT BIGGER SPOILERS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CURIOUS ABOUT HOW SILLY THE GAME GETS-----

I just want to tell you a little about the story of the game so you know how silly it gets. Basically it gets to the point where the CIA wants to open portals to the infra world to control the ghosts and use them as a weapon and they ask Jodie to help them.

I received this game as a Christmas present (gee, what a crappy gift) back in the late 90's.  I thought to myself ""well, all the N64 players have Goldeneye, I can compete with them when I receive Syphon Filter for my Playstation!""  How wrong I was.

It's not that the actual game is bad.  I mean, walking around shooting people is fun, and it's also fun to avoid being seen and make it to the end of the level without having to fire your weapon once (and having to remain VERY quiet while doing so).  The problem is that the difficulty is incredibly high and the storyline is about as interesting as watching the paint your baby brother smeared all over your television set dry.

Without a certain special code it's REALLY hard to get *anywhere*.  The storyline is similar to one you'd see in the TV show Jag.  It's just not interesting to me.  Walking around shooting people is fun, but that's all the game has going for it.  Now imagine if that special code didn't exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots.  The difficulty would be out of this world.

I also hate the game for the bad memories connected to it.  The Christmas I got the game, I had a few bad personal things happen.  But looking back, Syphon Filter really isn't any good.

Diablo 2 was fun for a while.  Not a long while like Neverwinter Nights, but a little while.  I didn't make it too far into the game because I lost track of the plot, and the game itself was far too repetitive.  Every battle seemed to be the same, and it was all too easy.  The battel system was just point and click, and there was no strategy to it at all.  I know, this is just supposed to be a hack and slash, but it fails even at that.

I have some Turtle Beach headphones that are slightly more expensive than these, but they do tend to become slightly uncomfortable after long periods of time.

So I ordered these. I was on the boat about the cord, but I actually prefer cords over wireless in such devices so that I don't have to worry about scrambling for batteries or charging it when the battery's low. The length of the cord is good for my living room.

When I plugged it into my PS3, having not yet read the instructions, I was surprised that there was no sound coming through. So I perused through the quick setup and was aghast that I, indeed, had to use the included audio jacks. I really really really really really don't like audio jacks. I understand that they might ""improve"" or have a work-around for audio, but the fact that I have to get my jacks out of my PS3 box just to plug `em into the back of the TV for audio (and since my TV has only one set of RCA ports, into which my Atari is plugged), it's really inconvenient and messy when I have to use the ol' red and white audio jacks. Haven't they done a work-around for this? I have HDMI cables, and I love `em. Surely Thrustmaster can do better. My Turtle Beach headphones, while understandably more expensive, connect into the front USB port...and that's it.

So when I finally did what Thrustmaster bid, I tried the sound quality, and it didn't negate my already negative feelings toward the headphones. The sound sounds almost tinny, and the headphones and their longest stretch barely fit `round my head, and I don't even have a big head! I usually click two or three times on headphones to make `em fit, but on these Thrustmasters I had to pull `em all the way and even then they fit just so.

I tried these on my iPhone, but the jack is a little big to fit with the case on my iPhone, so I took it out and tried the sound. It was rather worse since it was meant to utilize the red and white audio jacks.
Disgusting.

Overall, I am disappointed. Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Creative and Turtle Beach headphones, but for the price Thrustmaster could do better. Or maybe even lower the price point.

2.0,False,"09 1, 2004",A3PVM541IR8EYE,B000271MCG,Doug Urquhart,"Other reviewers have described the premise, so I won't repeat it. The game is a multi-stage puzzle - a series of little shockwave games - some verbal, some visual, some involving a certain amount of dexterity (not a lot, fortunately). The games are infuriating at times, but given that their author is supposed to be a serial killer, one must make allowances.

The idea of searching the web for clues, and receiving emails from other 'participants' is quite innovative, and adds to the immersion. Since the game has been published in Europe for some time, though, the searches also uncover walkthroughs. Bit of a temptation, that.

The production values are excellent - the video sections are slick, with lots of very photogenic European locations, the acting is good, and the overall design is spot on. the story is compelling and the characters are sympathetic.

For the most part, I enjoyed this game.

So why the 2-star rating? Some annoying technical issues and a lousy ending.

First, the technical issues:

-  When you first play the game, you have to log on,  using a user name you created yourself plus a password assigned by the game. Better write this on a piece of paper because you'll need it every time you play. Don't these people know about cookies?

-  You can't save the game - it decides on the restart point. It isn't always where you would like to restart.

-  The game is supposed to integrate with your email client. Mine didn't - I use Eudora, and it fixated on Outlook Express(which then tried to take over, the way it does). I had to work around this by loading my email client before running the game. This is important because emails often contain clues.

-  The game was a CPU hog. When it was running, other applications didn't get a look in. Since the whole point of the game is that it coexists with a web browser and email client, this isn't good. A workaround is to use the XP task manager to drop the priority of the task 'missing.exe'. Maybe it's part of the game:).

And as for the ending......(No spoilers, don't worry). Imagine that you've spent several hours working towards the denouement. At the very last minute, the screen goes blank and your only way of finding out what is going on is to wait for emails from the eye witnesses. These come in over a period of time. It's either designed to heighten suspense or the developers ran out of money.

It's a shame how this game turned out: at the beginning, I really liked it.

2.0,False,"01 18, 2013",A1PHYRHC9QN8XG,B009AGXH64,BoardGameNoob,"First, let me say that I wasn't one of the ""first responders"" to the Wii U. I literally found out about it two days before it came out last Fall. I've been out of the video gaming world for about a year because it was consuming me (I'll spare you the gory details). I've been easing myself back into it, and once I heard that a new hardware platform was coming out from dear old Nintendo - ahead of the Xbox 720 and PS4 - my curiosity piqued.

So for Christmas 2012, my lovely fiance - unbeknownst to me - purchased the Wii U Deluxe edition for me. At my age, even though I was interested in the console and kind of wanted to check it out, I didn't think I'd get it so soon. After all, there were so many shortages at launch that I figured I'd be fine waiting until later 2013 to get it. Add to that my incredible skepticism that Nintendo would put out an HD console that had third-party support ahead of the competition, and needless to say, I was scratching my head.

The launch seemed to be a mixture of good and bad reports. Shorter than expected battery life of the GamePad's battery (true); no real performance numbers known for the new Wii (true; no one still seems to know just how powerful it is); strong initial third-party support, even though most of the offerings were ports of existing games on the other two consoles (true); reports that the Wii U isn't as powerful as the 360 or PS3 (false); and it goes on and on. None of that matters now because I own it. And I love it. The apps, the accessibility, the lack of those stress-inducing achievements/trophies, a solid interface, solid hardware, HDMI cable in the box (come on Microsoft, really? You can't offer a cable with your 360?), USB hard drive support up to 2 TB, full Wii backward compatibility support, and the list goes on. Sure, Nintendo Land is completely lame (sorry, just not my bag whatsoever at age 35), but at least the console came with EVERYTHING you need to play your old Wii games, and NO new accessories are needed whatsoever. The sensor bar comes with it, and all the Wii controllers work with it.

I like how I can play games on my Wii U remotely on the GamePad's 6.2"" LCD screen. Just find a wall outlet to keep it juiced and you're good to go (or the battery extender from Nyko, forthcoming). The Wii U will allow you to run games wirelessly up to about 20-25 feet from the console base. Someone else can be watching TV, but you can be playing your game on a beautiful tablet-like interface. The GamePad's screen isn't going to rock your socks like the iPad retina display, but it's very nice and definitely high quality. And you can use your fingers or a stylus on it, whereas the iPad you need to use your body signals (fingers only, let's hope).

I bought Batman Arkham City: Armored Edition, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, and Mass Effect 3 Special Edition. I have only played Batman thus far because, again, I'm pacing myself, but it's just amazing in the detail. Every bit as good as the other editions (I have it for PS3, as well). There's NO difference, and honestly the GamePad integration is so cool that that feature alone makes this edition the best one. Plus, it has all the DLC included. I also have some experience with purchasing a game from the eShop, Nintendo's online store. I purchased Trine 2: Director's Cut, and the experience buying the game right on the GamePad was positive. The download, at around 2GB, took about 15-20 minutes...kind of lengthy with my broadband connection...but it installed quickly and ran smoothly (and is one of the most graphically stunning games I've ever seen).

Then it was on to the Miiverse, Nintendo's online community. Each game has its own discussion board, which you can add to your favorites under your profile for easier management. You can add comments and generally participate in threads like you can on your PC. The typing is slower with a stylus or your finger, but it works and with 100 character limitations on comments, you're not typing novels anyway. But it's nice because you can connect with people who are playing the games you are, and vice versa. The chat function works independently from the Miiverse. The GamePad's integrated camera is used for video chatting; again, like the 6.2"" screen, it won't win awards, but it's clear and it works.

Right now it's way too soon for me to make any kind of prediction on how Nintendo will do in 2013 and beyond, but it's clear they need to get moving with the advanced hardware and GamePad interface if they are to get a grip on a market that has all but slipped from their fingers. Call of Duty, Black Ops 2 has only about 3,000 players worldwide on their multiplayer servers, which is abysmal to say the least. But I'm not discouraged. Most hardcore gamers like me have more than one console since EACH of them offers something unique and cool, mostly in their games. Talk about apps and services all you want, ultimately it comes down to the games. Will the next Zelda really shine? I think so, and I hope it transports me back to the days of my youth when I discovered my favorite elf in green.

UPDATED 3/5/14: Well, it's been over a year and there's barely 50 games available for the WiiU. I'm having a rough time considering I gave the WiiU such a rave at first during the first month of launch. I'm highly disappointed with the console, the lack of games, the waning third-party support, and exclusives that ended not being exclusives. Still no new, more mature Zelda game, just an HD remake of a 10-year-old WindWaker (great game regardless, but reboots of old games are getting stale as all three of the ""next gen"" consoles are cashing in on old game remakes). More of the same gimmicky stuff that developers are abandoning for easier-to-develop-for PS4/XBone (though I can argue that the XBone is not nearly as easy to develop for as the PS4). I'm sad to report that I've dropped the WiiU down to two stars. I look like an idiot for constantly believing in Nintendo when they constantly let me down. The WiiU has been nothing but a dust collector for almost a year. Nothing good came out for it except for the BARELY decent Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, which is another rehash of the same tired 2D mechanics...and it has more complicated controls than previous DKC games.

Of course, to back up my changed review, Nintendo recently (end of 2013) announced abysmal sales projections for the WiiU and changed the projection while their CEO took a six-month slashed salary. Not a good sign, Nintendo. I have faith, but it's waning now for sure in light of yet another failed piece of gimmicky hardware with a major gap in the game library.",A solid next-gen effort turned sour in a year...,1358467200,5,,

Additionally, I had been a fan of the Wolfenstein franchise from the early 90s.

Unfortunately, the game has come up short on several fronts. Let me itemize the good and the bad:

The Good
- Graphics are very well done. The textures and cut scenes look very good although not quite as 'advanced' looking as I would have expected on a next gen console. But nonetheless, still quite impressive.
- The weapon play and controls are done well and the menu options are intuitive and easy to comprehend

The Bad
- The story drags terribly. As an FPS with a single player campaign, I understand the need for brief interludes here and there. But this game utilized them too frequently, basically stalling forward movement and creating a fragmented storyline that had too many instances of minimal action and extended areas of un-necessary dialog. Better editing would have helped tremendously here.
- The game is EXTREMELY buggy. This was, hands down, the biggest frustration point. It all began when attempting to install the game, which is a requirement for play. The installation procedure failed numerous times at the offset. I had to repeatedly restart the install in order to get to the point where I could play the game. Unfortunately, that is where I ran into the second problem: the game started to repeatedly freeze during gameplay. The good thing is on next gen consoles, you can stop the game like a mobile app without having to reboot the console. But the freezes were happening at virtually the same point in the game. After searching online for answers, I found numerous users were experiencing similar problems. After reading some tech notes, most recommended deleting the game and re-installing it while the console was not connected to the internet. I did that, although I ran into problems with the install yet again. Once the second install was complete, I could move forward into the campaign only to encounter ANOTHER point where the game would arbitrarily freeze at certain points. Despite restarting the game, the freezes would not allow me to continue. I now proceeded to delete and reinstall the game for a THIRD time. Once again, I could proceed in the campaign only to encounter the game freezes further on! At this point, I finally reached my breaking point and stopped playing.
It is very obvious that Bethesda did NOT do an adequate job of proper QA on this game, as I have read numerous stories online of users encountering similar issues. I emailed Bethesda tech support asking for assistance and received no reply.

Ultimately, the game itself could have been a good showcase for next gen consoles, but these quality issues really put a damper on the playability of the game as a whole. I hope Bethesda is taking time to deal with these issues so other gamers have a more fluid gaming experience.",Basically unplayable,1404604800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

For me personally, I returned this because of a few reasons.

First, it needs another column of buttons to be really useful.  It has many modifiers and could probably work over time, so this wasn't a deal breaker.

Second, it's not comfortable and the adjustments are minimal.  The slider can barely move.

Tetris catalyzed this genre's marriage of pattern-recognition with near-instantaneous player reaction, which has long since become the primary element of games from Dr. Mario to Bust-A-Move. The reason Tetris remains the archetype for the genre is lost on a game like Zoo Keeper; in a round of Tetris, the player is always 'building' their game, despite the mound of blocks being constructed only to then be skillfully eliminated from play. Games that successfully model the Tetris experience ooze a sense of control and personality.

Zoo Keeper keeps it simple, but not in the refreshing, Spartan manner of its superior competitors. The gameplay consists of you switching the position of two adjacent animal icons in order to make a 'capture' of three straight animals. Variants of this game abound (for historians, this is the Sega `Columns' genealogy); there are several online derivations, but often they challenge you to clear the screen - thus, a puzzle with a solution. No such goal in Zoo Keeper; in the main mode, you play until retinal failure. They count on the quirky presentation to get you in the door, what with the intransigent balding Zoo Manager and a slew of blocky, impossibly cute zoo creatures.

While any constant visual input can be mildly engaging, Zoo Keeper ultimately feels like a game one would find free-of-charge on Yahoo games (""Bejeweled,"" to be precise). Primarily, I question how much gameplay exists beyond the simple recognition of available moves. The game's puzzle mode would have you believe that there is something resembling deeper gameplay here involving combos and chains, but the nature of the constantly refreshing screen (pieces fall from above as they are eliminated from the playing field) lend this game a degree of randomness that belies any sense of planning. Granted, maybe I'm just not apt enough at reading the entire screen as a whole, but this game delivers scant satisfaction when the occasional 10-chain hits the board. How much does the player have to do with the chains when they are so often supplied by the pieces randomly falling from the top of the screen? A Zoo Keeper Zen state would be about as interesting as mastering a word search puzzle, your eyes blurred on a field of letters.

There have been times in life in which I have sought out fairly mindless diversions such as Zoo Keeper; the modicum of skill they award, combined with the hypnotic gameplay and eye-darting around the screen, can produce a pleasantly thoughtless state (a state I enjoyed in avoiding my undergraduate work). At the end of the day, this game dutifully serves its function of wasting your free time.","Cute, Pointless",1139443200,5,,

Let's start with the pros.  The brightest star in this game is its really simple control scheme.  You can pick up the game and start winning fights right away even if you are not used to playing fighting games.  The graphic is decent - it's nowhere near Virtua Fighter 4 in its quality, but it is pretty good in its own right.  The color pallette used here is darker to fit the storyline.  You have two meters combined, one is your energy and the other one is another meter which when full allows you to execute super moves.
Now its time to talk about the cons.  This game is definitely no Soul Calibur, Tekken, Virtua Fighter, or Dead or Alive in regards to graphics.  The characters' moves are basically clones of Tekken and Virtua Fighter, especially the Capoera using character (like Christy Montiero and Eddy Gordo of Tekken) whose moves are almost exactly like those Tekken characters.  Also, if you play a lot of fighting games, this game may be too easy for you, as many moves can be pulled off quite simply.
Right now the weakness of X-Box is in two categories: Fighting games and RPGs.  This game is definitely not going to help the X-Box much in the fighting arena.

Stealth is only relevant in the beginning, and from there the game becomes a clunky tank-fest. The story is confusing at best, and the characters are cliched shells.

The controls genuinely feel worse than the first Resident Evil game. The game intentionally has mechanics in place to make it harder to control.

For example - the pistol you start with has a crosshair that I quickly learned to ignore. It's a series of five dots - one in the middle, two on the top on bottom, the same for the sides. Why doesn't it work? Because I can literally center an enemy's head in it and still miss, with my shot going well outside of the graphic.

How is that fair? I took my time, aimed properly, and still missed. Oh and guess what? Every enemy around you now knows where you are and comes chasing you. The best thing to do is to forget the skillshot headshots and aim for center of mass - total fair in my book. The best part of Resident Evil 4 for me was making enemy heads pop - so satisfying! You won't get any of that here, though - if you get lucky and the game decides that your shot DOES land on the head - the head only half explodes and the enemy is still alive - and chasing you!

That's just one example of why this game is incredibly bad and frustrating. Also, it has a slew (and I mean a ton) of instant deaths - not fun in my book. It doesn't give you any indication as to what you're doing right or wrong - it's all trial and error. Do I fight the boss or run? Is there some sort of trap I can use? Well, go die five or six times and you might figure it out! Nobody likes dying unnecessarily - especially when the game keeps telling me I can lower the difficulty - its borderline insulting.

As someone that killed Resident Evil 4 on the highest difficult (another Mikami game) this game is frustrating beyond belief, even on normal. I can accept a loss if I genuinely did something wrong, but this game strikes to belittle you at every chance it gets.

I'm just glad that I got this on Black Friday when they did a $35 price drop (to $25). If I had paid $60 for this I'd have complained to customer service and requested a refund.",This game is genuinely bad.,1418860800,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

A little blue dragon with big horns, wearing some kinda scuba suit- that's certainly a cool design. But when you start to use the guy in Skylanders, it's clear that Zap's going to need a heck of a lot of stat upgrades to be of much use. What really bites is that Gill Grunt, one of the Skylanders that comes with the game, outclasses Zap in every possible way. Who would've guessed that about what most would assume is a lower level character? I think Zap and Gill Grunt should've switched roles, with Gill Grunt being the one available in character packs or on his own.

It's hard to say much good about Zap apart from the design. The one thing he has going for him is speed. Zap is very fast, with one of his moves being a 'sea slime' move that propels him forward, leaving a trail of slime behind that stuns and damages enemies. This will be your main way of getting around because it's so quick, and navigating through levels is a breeze.

And that about does it for the pros! What's so bad about Zap, you might be asking? While I did say in my review of the Skylanders game that there's no such thing as a bad Skylander...that every one is good in their own way, I still stand by that. But compared to all the others, Zap is at the bottom of the barrel. His two main powers are a lightning bolt shock that he can shoot, and the sea slime rush. The lightning bolts are incredibly weak and only worth using if you choose to upgrade this attack as fast as possible. If you're in an area with a lot of enemies, there's a good chance that by the time you've killed one of them, the others will have ganged up on you. Your best bet is to slide around with the sea slime move while shooting or play tag with the enemies. Zap's unique move that makes use of the circle button on the ps3, is basically the same thing as the sea slime move, but with a water shield in front of Zap that lets him attempt to plow through enemies. Of all the things they could've given him...this was the best they could do. Great. On top of this, Zap has very lower HP, making him prone to dying quickly by those enemies or obstacles that hit repeatedly. Finally, his Soul Gem ability lets him recover HP while in water. Yeah, I'm sure that'll come in handy for all those levels that don't have a whole lot of water.

But if you go through all of the Challenges to boost Zap's stats as far as they can go, he can be a pretty decent character. That's if you're willing to invest the time though.

Despite the rather awkward name of ""Resident Evil"", which is just plain out laughable, the title has become a household name. This movie-like, horror series can be written down as a new genre of gaming, horror. Yeah, very few games caused gamers to devastatingly sob (Aeries' funeral in Final Fantasy VII), some games built mystery or suspense (Gray Fox's desperate attack and impressive dialogue in Metal Gear Solid), but Resident Evil led the player to leap in fright or frantically jitter. Capcom inserted blood-thirsty zombies as the adversary, and the player's fear as the biggest opposition. In a sense, it is a movie.  Useless to say, Resident Evil was among the titanic series that landed on the Sony PlayStation. The original game presented an amazing surface. However it suffered from terrible voice acting and a somewhat dull story. Capcom extremely went hard at work for their sequel. Powerful hype erupted when Resident Evil 2 was announced. Anxious gamers couldn't wait to get their grubby paws on a copy. Resident Evil 2 altered the gaming industry. Other home console companies decided to cash in while the genre was sizzling hot. Konami cashed in with Silent Hill. Survival/Adventure games went mainstream.  After RE2 respectfully lived, a third installment was introduced, this time hype was scarce. It came out too quickly and sources claimed the interface was going to be identical as the other two. Fearing the worst, the third installment seemed to be a horrible move for Capcom.  And is.  From the experience of the two Resident Evil games, the player may expect the ""scare moments."" While playing on a big screen t.v., with surround sound, the volume almost reverberating the room, and a sudden pack of grunting zombies crashing out a window, I felt no fear.

Though few changes have been added, RE3 fails to take a leap over the original Resident Evil 2. In other words just imagine playing Resident Evil 2 but with more rooms and more puzzle solving.  RE2 is the strongest and most remembered in the series. When catching a glimpse of RE3, excitement was absent. RE3 seems it brought the entire series in shame. The story must take a new direction!

4 stars: Total War games are a great mix of battle tactics and grand strategy. While the latter is not very sophisticated, it is developed enough to make for a lot of fun. Managing cities and castles, deciding to launch a crusade, making effective use of assassins, spies, priests, princesses and generals, managing diplomatic relationships with the Pope, etc. are definitely an integral part of the game and can be very funny. However, not being the best at it won't necessarily make you lose the game either. In order to win, you need first and foremost to be good at battles. And if you're really the best, you can more than make up for not managing your empire too well. Battles are really what make Total War a unique game. While I read many history books only Total War made me grasp really well the meaning of the words that these books use to describe battle tactics. I'm sure it could be improved a lot further but at the present point in time I haven't encountered any better game than Total War as far as (ancient) battle tactics.

0 stars: I played Rome Total War for thousands of hours. I bought Medieval thinking of discovering much improved battle settings. I was disappointed on both battles and strategy. In general there is little improvement that I can see. The addition of some agents like princesses and priests and the distinction between cities and castles are no game changer, more like unnecessary distractions. The relationship with the Pope is similar to the relationship with the Senate in Rome Total War. Crusades don't present anything really interesting. But what really makes my rating go down is the overall visibility. I find it harder to `read' the map (distinguishing my agents from my enemies', spotting where armies are, what my regions are, etc.) and even more importantly, the battle camera doesn't give me as good a view as in Rome Total War. I tried all possible camera settings, brightness, contrast to no effect. To the point that it is harder to evaluate the distance between units, their type or their speed than in Rome. Time compression doesn't show exact remaining time when hovering the mouse over the indicator, cavalry doesn't always run when ordered to (looks very much like a bug), enemy units don't show their morale level (maybe intentional), etc. I gave the game a chance for about 2 weeks but I now stopped playing.",No real improvement from Rome Total War,1282694400,3,"{'Edition:': ' Gold', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

We'll review the 2004 GBA title and then ""Metroid"" itself.  The Classic NES series can be seen as a forerunner to the far superior ""Virtual Console"" on the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS.  Unless you are a collector don't bother getting these games.  Of course, in 2013 when this review was written, only collectors would be seriously scouring the globe for such titles, as pretty much all twelve titles in the Classic NES series are now available on the far superior Virtual Console for a fraction of the cost.

GBA METROID REVIEW:  With the advent of the Gameboy Advance, Nintendo decided to re-release select titles from the NES library of titles.  In Japan, the series was known as the Famicom Mini product line and in US/Pal as the Classic NES titles.  While Japan got THIRTY titles in all, the US/Pal regions only got a simpering twelve titles (""Bomberman"", ""Donkey Kong"", ""Excitebike"", ""Ice Climber"", ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Pac-Man"", ""Super Mario Bros."", ""Xevious"", ""Castlevania"", ""Dr. Mario"", ""Metroid"", ""Zelda II: The Adventure of Link"").

Critical reception to the series was mixed to say the least, with complaints about changes maded to various games and price issues.  Of the twelve titles released, only ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Metroid"", ""Zelda II"", ""Castlevania"", and PERHAPS ""Super Mario Bros."" really justified the twenty dollar purchase price (which was the MSRP).  The other eight titles simply did not justify the high purchase price, generally due to short gameplay.

""Super Mario Bros."" had already been re-released in 1999 as ""Super Mario Bros. Deluxe"", which featured superior features and an unlockable version of ""The Lost Levels"", although the aspect ratio was off due to the smaller screen size of the Gameboy Colour.  Likewise, there were also aspect ratio issues with this re-release of ""Super Mario Bros.""

The two ""Legend of Zelda"" NES titles (along with the two N64 titles) had been recently re-released in 2003 as part of the Zelda Promo anthology that Nintendo literally gave away, which takes away from the appeal of the Classic NES series.  The only advantage of the GBA versions were they were hand-held versions of these early classic essential titles.  Both Zelda titles had been out of print since the NES days, so their re-release was fantastic, but I had gotten them already.

So now we get to ""Metroid"".  Like the two ""Zelda"" titles, the value of the Classic NES GBA version was questionable to say the least due to then recent commercial products formally issued by Nintendo to the marketplace.  And unlike the two Zelda re-releases, the ""Metroid"" re-release did not even have that advantage of exclusive ""hand-held"" gaming that could have possibly allured a gamer to purchase said title.

Barring the original NES release, by 2004 games could access ""Metroid"" in three different titles.  By using a special cable connecting a Gameboy Advance to a Gamecube, when you linked the GBA ""Metroid Fusion"" to the Gamecube ""Metroid Prime"" unlocked the NES version.  Also, after completing the GBA ""Metroid: Zero Mission"", itself a remake of ""Metroid"", the player again could unlock ""Metroid"".  I used both methods to play ""Metroid"" back in that era.  Because I owned (and loved) ""Zero Mission"", I passed on buying the Classic NES re-release.

Why should you pay for something that you have gotten free as an unlockable bonus for in a far superior release?  Like the two Zelda rereleases I simply gave this one a pass.

And that was largely the problem with the Classic NES series.  There simply wasn't much value to the games Nintendo chose to release due to the aforementioned reasons already given in this review.

The real heartbreaker (and the one title I would have bought back in 2004 without a doubt) was Nintendo released ""Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels"" on the Famicom Mini series.  Unfortunately they did not publish that game across the waters, leaving it only as yet another Japan exclusive.

METROID REVIEW:  ""Metroid"", the original 1986 NES classic, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto's mentor Gunpei Yokoi, stands tall in Nintendo's back catalogue as an undisputed classic and [the start of] a heavy hitting franchise to boot.  General consensus is while ""Metroid"" is easily one of the best of the early NES titles, as a series the game is rather rough around the edges.

What can pass as market-ready game design in 1986 simply doesn't fly in subsequent years.  Like the 1992 title  ""The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past"" did to the original 1987 ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Super Metroid"" took the basic blueprint of ""Metroid"" and so drastically and radically built and improved upon said blueprint that sometimes it's hard to go back to the original.

In regards to my own play history, my parents bought me ""LTTP"" in the early 1990s and I played through ""Link to the Past"" countless times throughout that decade.  It was only in 1999 that I actually played through the original ""The Legend of Zelda"".  Having grown up with ""LTTP"", I found the original Zelda somewhat lacking, simply because LTTP takes everything that is so brilliant about the original Zelda and exponentially improves upon it.

In the ""Metroid"" my play history is completely reversed.  I seriously began playing ""Metroid"" in 2002, having never played ""Super Metroid"" (other than a few brief instances in the 1990s). Aalthough I briefly played the game in the 1980s, I but never got out of Brinstar.  In 2002 I completed the game several times over and then went on to ""Super Metroid"".  To me, ""Metroid"" will always remind me of my college days.

The game is a massive maze.  There is no map (which really isn't surprising since this is 1986).  A lot of the areas look similiar or have idential room layouts (this is especially true of Kraid's Hideout and parts of Ridley's Hideout, Norfair and Brinstar).  The similarities and copy and paste design of certain sections of ""Metroid"" can make it rather hard to know where you are at unless you are intimately familiar with the game, and can be rather disconcerting and confusing to say the least.  The game features substantial amounts of backtracking (which may or may not been seen as a flaw; personally, ""Metroid"" is by definition an exploration so some [the] backtracking is to be expected).

There are frequent transitions from one room to the next (again, common in Kraid's Hideout which features a fast moving flying enemy) where an enemy can pass through a door as Samus exits/enters, thus sustaining unavoidable damage.  Samus cannot shoot diagnally and also cannot shoot while ducking, which can be rather challenging.  Samus is able to get two different projectiles: the Wave Beam and the Ice Beam.  Unfortunately, you cannot have both and the Ice Beam is required for the last section of the game, Tourian.  So if you get the Wave Beam during the course of gameplay, ultimately you will have to get the Ice Beam again (which is available in two locations and SOMEWHAT close to Tourian's entrace).

Another big complaint is that, like Kid Icarus, Samus starts out very underpowered.  While being underpowered is not necessarily a bad thing, ""Metroid"" can be rather unforgiving to first time players.  Kid Icarus is one of the few platforming titles that actually gets easier the further you progress due to leveling up Pit's powers.  In regards to ""Metroid"", a significant draw back is how the energy refilling works.  You are able to get up to six energy tanks of 99 Health each.  However, if you die you start out the game with only 30 health and essentially have to grind your way up by killing these various enemies to regain your health.  The more energy tanks you have, the longer this process takes, and is rather monotonous.

However, for 1986, the game is classic. While these gameplay issues can be frustrating, the game is tremendously fun, especially compared to what was on the market in 1986.  ""Metroid"" was an indepth, expansive game, among the first to feature multiple endings (contigent upon how much time you took to beat the game), filled to the brim with secrets, with some amazing sound effects (still love the sound for finding an item!) and music.  Samus Aran is also famous for being one of the first female video game protaganist antagonists in a medium dominated by [males] male characters, and her secret identity was a big plot twist in an era notable for its LACK of narrative.

Yes, everything ""Metroid"" does, ""Super Metroid"" does better, while removing all the commonly accepted ""flaws"" of the original.  Still, for my money, I'll always love ""Metroid"" more, probably because, unlike ""The Legend of Zelda"" and ""A Link to the Past"", I first played through the original before going to the SNES title.  That may have made its rough edges far more paltable to me than had I been a ""Super Metroid"" junkie and then tried playing through the original.  I have a much more emotional attachment to it than the SNES one, despite how amazing the SNES game truly is.",Not much value unless you're a collector,1360713600,,,

The graphics, game play, and controls are okay.  The checkpoint system makes this game frustrating.  If you get defeated, go back to the last checkpoint.  If the game crashes, go back to the last checkpoint.

Had I known this was a checkpoint game, I would not have bought it.  This is a Steam game, so once you play it, you can not resell it.

In the single player campaign, some of the boss fights are very difficult...they do not scale with the difficulty you choose (I was playing on ""normal"" and tried ""easy"").  And there are about 4 bosses that don't die; when you almost destroy them, then they come back to life and fly away (and you get to fight them again later).  Silly and frustrating.

The female soldier and the female mercenaries are annoying and immature.  At least half of the script is cliched and cheesy.

The story is still short and linear but the loot has been improved tremendously.  The weapons are better (I have Legendary items from pre v2.0 that have worse stats than the rares I get now) and the armor and weapons you get are more tuned for your character. In the past I kept getting items for other characters all the time.  Now that's a rarity.  One other major improvement is I no longer have the jerky, stuttering movement that I had in the past.  I'm guessing it's because Blizzard moved all the calculations to my computer instead of the servers.  Diablo 3 never needed to be an online game, that was just the excuse Blizzard used to promote the garbage Auction House that is now gone for good.  We still have multiplayer, though, so bring your friends.  Also, you can now choose what difficulty you want upfront.  No more being forced to play easy mode.

Original Review:

The hype was strong and I almost bought this on day one because I love hack-n-slash RPG's.  No sense bringing up the mess that was Blizzard's attempt at forcing us to play a *single-player game* over an always-online connection.  Even now (patch 1.05 as of the time of this review) I experienced stuttering movement and other latency issues.  Plus, there's nothing like starting up a solo game and finding out you can't play because the remote servers are down (yes, it still happens.)  It's so annoying that I will never pay full price for any ""always on"" requirement and I hope others will do the same.

As far as D3 the game is concerned, there are three things I think Blizzard has done better than the competition.  First, the art style is incredibly well done with unique, detailed environments.  Secondly, the level design is excellent.  So many times I tried to game the system by making my way down paths I believed would take me directly to a dungeon exit.  Instead, I found myself consistently fooled into clearing out the entire level before I was able to progress in the story.  Finally, unlike nearly every RPG to date, your companions are both intelligent and useful.  You actually want them around when the battles get difficult.

Unfortunately, these positives can't save the fact that the game is very short.  My character completed the story in 25 hours and I like exploring areas searching for hidden treasures and secret dungeons.  If you played the game straight through and avoided the side quests, you could probably complete it in under 20 hours.  In addition, I was only able to make it to level 32 before the game was finished.  Since the level cap is 60, I'll need to play through the story a second time just to unlock all of my available skills.  Speaking of which, you have no choice what difficulty level to play.  The game forces you to play ""normal"" difficulty (which is actually quite easy) before you can play the next highest difficulty level.  The quests are remarkably standard and while crafting was available, we were locked out of using items we crafted unless we hit an arbitrary level.  Starting to get the picture?  Instead of being given the freedom to go where you want and do what you want, Diablo 3 holds your hand and tells you what you can and cannot do.  It's so linear that it's like playing the single-player campaign of a FPS except in third-person view.

Fortunately, I purchased this game at a major discount but I would have been upset like many of the other reviewers if I paid full price.  Since you're only getting half a game, I would recommend purchasing this at half price and that's only if you're a big fan of the genre.  Just don't forget you'll have to go through the hassle of signing up for an online account as if you were playing a MMO.  If you're not a fan of the genre, avoid this game altogether.  Blizzard is asking too much and providing too little.  A much more enjoyable, and less expensive alternative is Torchlight II.","Beautiful, linear, and much too short",1351814400,9,{'Format:': ' Computer Game'},

2.0,False,"09 14, 2006",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000FDKZR0,Tsanche,"Lego Star Wars is perhaps one of the best games to be released this year.  It's absolutely fantastic in it's execution.  As usual, though, the handheld versions get the short end of the stick.  The PSP version of Lego Star Wars is just about the same as the console version.  I was expecting the DS version to be identical, but on a less graphical scale.  I was wrong.  There's more changed in this than ever, and to be honest, it just isn't all that it's cracked up to be on the Nintendo DS.

You begin in the Mos Eisley Cantina.  This is the hub, and where you'll be able to select an episode you wish to play.  At first you'll only be able to choose Episode IV, but after you complete the first chapter, you'll be able to dwell into Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.

Playing through these levels isn't nearly as exciting as it is on the console counterparts.  The game is fully rendered in 3D, and you'll have all sorts of characters at your command.  You'll blaster toting characters, jedi, ewoks, Chewie and plenty more.  Characters also have their own unique moves.  Leia has her slap, Chewbacca can run up to a stormtrooper and rip his arms from his sockets.  Jedi can use the force.  Jawas and Ewoks can do down shutes and reach places characters can't.  Characters who wield a blastertech can use a grappling hook to reach other areas, while droids may have to open up doors.  There's a lot of variety.  You'll be in a party the whole time, and you'll often have to switch to other characters.  For example, Han Solo can't open doors, and so you'll have to let C-3PO do it.  There are doors that R2-D2 can open, but C-3PO can't.  So you can't just barge through a level as just one character.

Playing through most of these levels though is a hassle.  The camera is often unfriendly.  There are moments when the camera swings around and suddenly you can't see yourself because you happen to be behind obstacles.  You might often die just because you can't see yourself, or in some instances the person your shooting.  The good news is that in Lego Star Wars there is no such thing as a game over.  The only penalty you receive is losing studs.  Still, you might suffer some deaths that could've easily been avoided had the camera let you see yourself.  You don't get much control over the camera either.  You can use the touch screen to control the camera, but you'll often have to take a break from combat just to use your stylus to control the camera.  And it's not a lot of fun since it'll often get stuck on other objects.  Having the camera be controlled through the touch screen wasn't such a good idea, either.  It probably would've been easier had it been set to L and R, since those buttons aren't really used for anything. The touch screen is also used for a few other things.  Switching between your characters, customizing them or navigating the menu for instnace.  The touch screen isn't an integral part of the gameplay, though, and you'll never find a moment when you'll actually have to use it.  It's just there to make things a little easier.  Such as only having to double tap a character icon to swith as opposed to going up to them and pushing X.  Other than that, you'll never find a moment when you absolutely must use the touch screen.

There are a ton of extras to be found in Lego Star Wars.  As you go through levels you'll collect Lego Studs that serve as currency in the cantina.  You can buy cheats, unlock characters this way, and plenty of other little things such as playing the game in medieval mode or something like that.

The heart of the extras comes from unlocking the characters and going back into levels with them.  When you unlock a character they'll be walking around the cantina.  You can switch to them and then enter any level you've already completed once.  This is freeplay mode, and in order to find everything and do everything in Lego Star Wars, you'll have to do this.  Unfortunately, some levels are of poor structure and just aren't as fun to play through a second time.  Especially the levels with awkward camera angles.  All you'll be doing in some cases is punishing yourself to fight with the camera again.  None of these levels are very long either, and some of them just aren't all out exciting.  They're not heavily populated with enemies and most of the time you'll be running down empty corridors.  Even worse, there's a little glitch in some levels where if you run around as a droid your enemies won't shoot at you at all.  It makes what could've otherwise been an exciting game, rather bland.

The controls are also either unresponsive or too loose.  In some levels where you pilot vehicles, such as the Hoth Battle, you'll find that control these vehicles is a pain.  You can't turn properly, and I often found myself caught up on some of the environments and couldn't get off because I had to fight with the camera just to find myself first.  In these levels the controls are rather loose.  In other levels such as when you run around blasting people, the controls sometimes don't respond until you've pressed the button two or three times.  The good news is, this doesn't happen too often.  The bad news is when it happens in a fire fight, or when you're supposed to jump over a pit.

Graphcially, the game doesn't look bad on the DS, but there are some flaws and bugs in the graphics.  Pieces of the environment getting cut off, or your character standing in mid air when he should be falling into a pit.  Usually just small little things.  There are also moments of slowdown.  The game certainly doesn't look bad, but these small little glitches and bugs can be tiresome to look at.  It feels like a game that was rushed out into development.

I wish I could tell you the music score sounds absolutely fantastic.  It will certainly remind you of the movies, but it sounds nowhere near as good as it could've have.  Many tunes actually sound like they belong on your Super Nintendo.  The Super Star Wars games certainly sound more true to the movies than this one does.  A lot of the music is tinny and hardly sounds like the movie.  This is strange considering on the GBA, Apprentice of the Force sounds very similar to the movies.  Here, it just could've sounded better.  It strange that they couldn't get the actual soundtrack to come through the speakers when the DS is fully capable of such.  It should sound just as good as the console versions, but it doesn't.  The tinny music sometimes makes me want to turn the volume down.

Lego Star Wars on the DS isn't bad, it just feels unfinished.  As usual, the handheld version gets the short end of the stick (with the exception of the PSP version of the game).  The Nintendo DS version is no where near as good as it could've been.  You're probably better off sticking to the console versions for this one.

The single adventurer, as well as the casual gamer or relative newcomer, will find little to no content whatsoever which is available to them in this expansion pack (past a certain point). It is all about groups and large scale raids. Solo gameplay in the ""Planes of Power"" zones is next to impossible, and that is appparently by design. In fact, several player class abilities were ""nerfed"" by Sony just prior to the release of this expansion, ostensibly to ""better balance the classes."" It is far more likely that those ""nerfs"" were enacted to prevent any possibility of traditional solo classes (such as Wizards and Druids) from being able to do any effective soloing in the new zones.
Another problematic feature of this add-on is the overpowered ""gear"" that one can obtain from the high-end encounters featured in ""PoP."" Introducing too much ""uber gear"" to an MMORPG game is precisely what ultimately ruined ""Diablo 2"" when the ""Lord of Destruction"" expansion was released. For many gamers, the focus becomes shifted away from roleplaying and game content, and instead toward greed for items which they can strut and show off to other players. It also tends to make player characters who *can* manage to obtain those items a bit too powerful, which hardly seems to fit in with Sony's highly questionable assertions... that several prior ability nerfs were done to ""better balance the classes."" If anything is true about ""Planes of Power,"" it's that it is decidely UN-balanced in the extreme.
Painfully short on game content, all too few and sloppily written quests, overly lengthy encounters and a generally poor payoff in the ""Plane of Time"" endzone are what one can expect from this mediocre expansion pack. Whilst it is a ""must have"" for all EverQuest players, it hardly stacks up well against prior expansions such as ""Scars Of Velious"" or ""Shadows Of Luclin"" so far as actual depth, atmosphere and overall content is concerned. This is also the first EverQuest expansion set which the original game designers (Verant International) had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with, and it shows. Moreover, ""Planes Of Power"" is an expansion pack which 99% of all players will never see the bulk of, due to their being unable to assemble the ""muscle"" required to fully explore the additional zones and adversaries. Not being able to see three quarters of a game you pay for is rather disappointing (to say the least), so unless you already belong to a highly-skilled player guild, do not expect to progress past a very superficial point in this add-on to EverQuest.
Lastly, ""The Planes Of Power"" tends to look and play more like a Sony PlayStation 2 game than an add-on for a classic PC based MMORPG. Storyline depth and roleplaying content has been replaced in favour of eye candy, overpowered enemies, and ridiculously and unnecessarily overpowered items designed to appeal to player egos. ""PoP"" is not entirely without merit, but depending on what you look for in a roleplaying game, you may be disappointed overall. Defenders of this add-on have often said to me  ""Well, Sony knows what sells, that's why PoP is the way it is, and that's the bottom line."" Naturally, I have no problem with manufacturers of PC games making a profit on their merchandise, but I see no reason why profits and product integrity need be mutually exclusive concepts.

I hope this review will help out those who love SvR2008 and are wondering if 2009 is a worthy upgrade to purchase or not?

Not a great deal has been changed in 2009 compared to the predecessor. Expected changes of coarse are changes to rosters and what superstars you can select. However more or less much is identical to the last game, however this version does not include any WWE Legends as extra characters; so do not expect to find The Rock or Stone Cold Steve Austin. Apart from that, the only updates I can see to the move sets seem to be you can now whip and an opponent into the corner, and when you run at them, you can toss them down and climb the turnbuckle as a combination move.

With that said, you might possibly think; well, if I want legends I should go with 2008, or if I don't want them, go with 2009. However that is not so much the case, as I did find many things in 2009 that I am really not happy about.

The first being glitches or programmers bungling their codes. It seems they didn't have very good testers as I discovered in the Elimination Chamber match, you cannot climb the turnbuckles. In 2008 you can, and then you can go from there and climb up onto the cages behind you for an aerial assault, but in 2009 they messed this up and you cannot get on the top ropes anymore in that match. If that did not sound bad enough, then here is a major reason to minus overall points from 2009; In 2008 it was always fun to go outside the ring, rip off the announce tables top, preform a strong left or right grapple (eg: choke slam), get your opponent up, walk them into the table, and send them crashing through it. In 2009, if you are close enough, your opponent might slap into the table, but it will not break. WTH THQ? One of the best features people loved in 2008 is ruined for 2009. BUT WAIT, there is still more! IF you give your opponent an Irish-whip to try and get them onto the table (you would whip them and they would roll onto the table) guess what? Your opponent rolls on the edge of the table, glitches as they move through the air, and land back on the mat next to the table. SERIOUSLY, THQ, DID YOU NOT TEST YOUR OWN PROGRAMMING? How could you mess that up? I have a feeling the code that is conflicting with is, in 2008 when both opponents where on top of the announce tables, playing in an Extreme Rules match, if one player had a finisher, you could execute it, and your player would enter the ring and jump off the top turnbuckle to the player on the table, causing it to break. Now that option seems to be available in every match. Hence not allowing you to preform your actual finisher on the table anymore.

Next thing I noticed was ""Hardcore"" has been deleted from the match options. It's no real biggie, as any match you can turn DQ off can become a hardcore match, and playing on the ECW show is a hardcore match just about every time anyway. Also deleted is the ""Buried Alive"" match. Personally, I never liked that match anyway, it was too simple and no fun. In there place they have added a 6 man Battle Royal. Really? 6 men in an over the top rope elimination match? BORING. They should have just given the option to say tossing your opponent over the top rope to the mat is an elimination, they did not actually need to make a match for it. Battle Royals consist of 10 to 50 men in the ring, but here you can play as 6, which let's be honest, would not attract ratings on a real wrestling show, so why would anyone wanna play it?

When it comes to creating your wrestlers; pretty much the only updates have been to logos. I can now choose the original DX shirt logos for front and back, but there should have been so much more other than just new hats and beards added. There is not a great deal of new things to create with, and what is new you probably would not use unless you enjoy making the whackiest characters possible.

Now a major bummer is when choosing your moves for your CAW, so many moves are missing from the game. There is no Sharpshooter/Scorpion Death Lock... I mean, I can understand that because Hulk Hogan is not in the game, I might not be able to find ""The atomic Leg Drop"" finisher, but just because Bret Hart is not in this game, why would you remove the ""Sharpshooter""? It makes absolutely no sense. It is possible the move is in the game somewhere, as I did notice there was 3 sets of extra CAW moves that can be unlocked if you do such and such in Road To Wrestlemania, but come on, why do they hide moves at all? No one in the real world beginning wrestling training is told they cannot preform certain moves until they have had 20 matches under their belt, it doesn't work that way, so why does THQ keep making you unlock these moves? But on a final note to the Sharpshooter, there doesn't seem to be a spot indicated with ""??????"" under where Sharpshooter or Scorpion Death Lock would be inserted. So I have my doubts the move is in the game at all. Even the Rock is not in this game, so his version wouldn't be included either. So who knows how many moves have been deleted in this version that where all included in the previous version.

Now, 2008 introduced the ""24/7 mode"" as your main career mode, where you play as a wrestler for as long as you like during each day of the year... that has been removed from this game, and they have instead introduced ""Road to Wrestlemania"" You can only pick 1 of about 8 wrestlers to compete in 82 matches or so to complete their quest. They have made better cut scenes and videos for these guys compared to 2008, but personally, some of these wrestlers I am not fans of, and do not want to play 82 matches with them just to unlock things. I really am not a fan of CM Punk, but I had to bore myself till his 10th match to unlock a backstage area for exhibition mode. Quite frankly, it was not worth it, as the two backstage areas of this game are a joke. In 2009 you had a part to the top right of the screen in some matches where you could exit the ring and go there to have some fun throwing your opponent into electrical equipment, and watching them blow up, or climb a scaffold and crash through them on a table, or receive weapons from people in the crowed... there was also a backstage parking lot brawl that was cool, if only you could turn KO off, but you could whip your opponent into things and find hot spots to preform certain area moves, or even just grapple them into one, but in 2009 you get a backstage storage area, where there is very little you can do in the area at all. You can whip them into a barrel that just moves around, a few bins that just roll over, a box that you can find maybe 2 weapons in, and a TV that does not explode. There is also a table and a ladder. However the area is not fun and boring as can be, there are no hot spots to preform cool area moves, there nothing to even dive off of. The second waste of time was unlocked the locker room, where again, no hot spots, you can just whip someone into the lockers and a weapon will fall down, or you can whip them into a TV or pot plant. God THQ, how is it ""Smackdown: Here comes the Pain"" ""Just Bring It"" and the other one can have such awesome backstage areas allowing you to go to the boiler room, parking lot, outside the arena, in the foyer, offices and what not, but a game made nearly 10 years later is given this rubbish as backstage areas? Please someone explain how they can be so idiotic to think the backstage areas in this game here would be fun to anyone?

There was a couple of things in 2008 that annoyed me, like whipping opponents into certain areas where they would not even collide into anything, such as the announce area once tables are gone, or anywhere up the ramp to the stage. You would think that would have been updated wouldn't you? Nope. It's the same, your opponent just jogs on the spot till the stop and turn around like nothing happened.

One cool thing about this game is the new ""Create a Finisher"". It's not bad, it's easy to figure out, however it is pretty limited and I could not create the move I wanted, but others may have a lot of fun creating them more than I did.

The Tournament modes have been brought back, However the ""King of The Ring"" has been ruined. It was OK in 2008 as you could simulate straight to your match and then you where shown a video of you accepting your crown... that's gone from 2009 and you also have to go to each match to simulate results for it. Just annoying. At least load times for this game are quicker than 2008, so that's one advantage, of very few.

Commentary doesn't seem to be updated much, I think they used a lot of what was already in 2008 and just added a few new ones here and there. Still becomes pretty annoying after a while hearing the same thing all the time, but god I wish they would remove the ""You won't see this kind of action on Smackdown"" or ""Do you think Raw will have anything this exciting next week?"" those must be some of the most irritating things to hear all the time in any commentary of any game, and they kept it for 2009! Sheesh.

There is also a mode for playing a small career as any wrestler you want. However it only consists of about 6 matches for each belt. Mostly what this mode is for is building your stats for a created superstar. The more of certain things you do in certain matches builds your attributes. Very easy to do, but I'd have preferred the ""WWE SHOP"" to return to just buy the points needed.

Well, that's about all I got to say about this game. In my personal opinion, I think the previous years 'Smackdown vs Raw' game was a much better game. Matches worked flawlessly, had better wrestlers (legends) and more moves to choose from. Had only 2008 introduced the create a finisher mode, and the aerial moves that can be preformed off the top of the ""Hell In a Cell"" then 2009 would have received a 1 star rating from me.",Bows Down to 2008,1366848000,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'}",

The concept is awesome, it's every (big) kids dream to run your own city the way you please. Simcity 4 first introduced the region, where you could really create a small country with numerous cities. So obviously, the new simcity was going to be something to have.

I have played 35 hrs since I receievd the game. Not bad, considering all the problems people have with the servers and yes, I been victim to not being able to play, cities not responding properly and what not. EA and maxis have really screwed up. If you let people pre-order, you should have a pretty good idea of how much server capacity you should have once the game is released. I think they have not done a very good job, to say it politely.

The game itself: City size is very small; only about 2 x 2 km, which gets you're land filled up in a hurry. Many complained about it, but I am a bit hesitant to simply say that it sucks: it also provides for a challenge, cos you have to think ahead and plan in order to achieve your goal.
More importantly, the game has great depth; there is a lot to do, alot to tend to and a lot to consider. From resources to wind direction, everything must be considered when you start building. If you don't have an idea of what you want to achieve with one city, you are likely to just make a mess with a lotta unhappy sims. The multi city feature is also great, although it has some glitches of things not always working correctly. Having a department of transportation in city A should allow you to reap the benefits of that in city B, but my experience so far with 3 cities is that it doesn't always work the way they said it would. I'm sure those glitches will be fixed, and being online to play allows for updates everytime you log in. So stuff can be addressed and fixed fairly quickly.
I would have prefered not needing to be online for playing (like a sandbox mode you can do off line) but I guess they have their reasons for doing this and it comes with pro's and con's. For the game to be enjoyable though, they need to make sure you can play anytime you want to play and that is not the case (yet). I am enjoying the game, but hating the poor service provided by EA/Maxis/Origin. That's why I only give it 2 stars, I hope it all gets better. If not, they will loose a lotta fans, including me.

Addition after a few months: must say that after playing Sim city for a while now, I got bored with it. Re started my cities, but basically you get into the same stuff and once you're city fills your small land area you ar epretty much done. Things like traffic (which has been fixed but still isn't great) gets stuck all thye time, garbage trucks follow each other on the same route, firetrucks get stuck in traffic on the way to a fire...

I would give Halo 4 the following rankings:
-Campaign 6 out of 10
-Multiplayer 4 out of 10
-Graphics 10 out of 10
-Lasting appeal 5 out of 10

Pros:
-It has the best graphics out of any halo game
-Its interesting and unique

Cons:
-The Campaign doesn't seem to fit in well with halo's 1, 2, and 3. The campaign just seemed too different and not like halo to me.
-The ranking system is bad. To rank up its just about how long you play. Multiplayer doesn't even give you the most exp to rank up, Spartan ops does
-The Multiplayer isn't very competitive
-The Multiplayer maps all seem the same, and aren't that creative.
-it got boring fast, at least for me.
-weapons are over powered

The Bottom Line:
Hey look, 343 tried to make a halo game that would shine and be better than all the rest. They changed halo too much! Almost all of the weapons are new! They just added to much to the game and it doesn't seem like halo to me. It seems honestly like a mix of call of duty and halo reach. This game is not how halo is supposed to be!

2.0,False,"03 4, 2009",AE3PQYXY49FJB,B0017HW5LM,Robert Schmidt,"I'll start off by saying that I was a HUGE fan of Halo 1.  I can confess I ruined my grades in high school by constantly playing it.  When Halo 2 came out, i was really disappointed in the game and I remember refusing to buy it (that last about 2 weeks when all my friends were constantly playing it).  I played that for about a year before quitting, upon seeing Halo 3 previews and seeing that it was virtually the same game i decided I was done with Halo, Bungie lost me.

I purchased End War last month, decided it was horrible so I returned it and reserved a copy of Halo Wars since I couldn't reserve Operation Flashpoint 2.  I played the demo, it seemed decent, the campaign was fairly enjoyable and it wasn't hard to manage forces.  Yesterday I picked up my copy, and decided to enjoy the evening on it.  4 Hours later the campaign was completed, and like Halo 2 I was left in shock at how short it was.  The story was bland and did not keep my attention at all.  I never got the sense of desperation like Halo 1 gave, nor did I get the sense of mystery.

The gameplay isn't bad, and the graphics are all right for an X-Box RTS.  The layout of the game is far better than other RTS's for consoles and its easier than others to move forces, but it still doesn't match PC RTS games so if you are coming from a PC background you will be disappointed.  The music as always is spectacular.

But here is where my really big complaints begin.  The campaign does not last at all, and it's very boring to replay, that leaves you with multiplayer.  If you are doing a 1v1 on a small map this game can be fun, you don't have units spread all over the map and the games are fairly short.  Try a 2v2 or 3v3 on a large map and it becomes pretty difficult to manage forces, you leave a zone for literally 3 seconds and an enemy force could appear and destroy everything you have, effectively ending the game for you.  In my opinion that's stupid.  The fog of war is very narrow (as with most any RTS games), which i realize does help out gameplay but I think it hurts it more.  You don't have time to detect and react to enemy forces, how often does that happen in real life?

Perhaps I'm trying to compare it too much to exellent RTS games like Company of Heroes, but even the story line was boring and that was what originally attracted me to Halo.  It seems that MS continues to advertise and promise but never delivers, they shorten their storyline (apparently have fired the original story writing team because it's aweful and repetitive now) so they can produce more crap to sell people.

As a friend of mine mentioned, it's got amazing cut scenes, but I didn't spend 60 bucks to watch a 20 minute movie.

Sorry to see the Halo franchise continue to suck, but I stayed away from wasting my money on Halo 3 and I wish I had done so here, because I've already sold my copy after owning it for 12 hours, and I will NOT be suckered into buying Halo 3 ODST.

When I loaded up the PS4 version, the game looked great (except for the eyebrows and some plays do not look like the person) and the controls were more or less the same as I had on 2K14 on PC (with 360 controller).  However, the game moves slowly and there is controller lag!

My mastery of an NBA game is based on speed and timing.  I had that in 2K14, but so far, I cannot have it with this one.  I am really speaking about online play.  I have 25Mbps connection, an R9280, Intel 4820 and 32GB of RAM - so I can handle anything.  I first thought that the sluggish play was a PS4 thing, so I figured I would go back to the PC and maybe that would speed things up.  Sadly, it is the same thing - sluggish play and horrible controller lag, making this game unplayable!

Blocking?  You can forget it!  The lag does not allow me to get back on defense fast enough.  This game also makes me miss easy basket too often and 3 point shots are too easy for anyone to make.  I would recommend taking the shot meter and symbols for what each player's specialty is off off and make players know who does what instead of simply being able to toss up 3's with ease.  This messes up strategy and allows for the non-skilled to appear to have skill.  I also want to be able to play all-star teams on line!  NBA Live used to do that.

I think that this games had great potential, too many options (they should start with standards and then let you adjust) and this game always had convoluted menu systems when it should be kept simple!  There should be one menu/settings that stand the same for offline and online, or two - one for offline and one for online.  That would make things easier.  Their menu system is why I shied away from previous games - bought them then sold them.  The first 2K game I kept was 2K14 the Dreamcast days.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
My kids are always hounding me about how their PS4 controllers are dead all the time. They don't seem to get that all it takes is to plug them up when they're done playing with them. Apparently that's way too much work. It's much easier to just moan and complain about it to Mom. So I bought this charger. It really is pretty great. All my lazy little kids have to do now is just set the controller on this stand when they're done. Seriously....it's that simple.

PROS: This thing is so easy to use. You don't have to do one single thing more than just setting your controller onto it when you're done. That's it. Just set the controller on it and it charges itself. Then, when you want to play again, the controller will be fully charged and waiting. Another great thing I really like about this is the blue lights. When you plug it in it will light up blue. That part looks so futuristic. It's pretty eye catching. All my sons' friends noticed and commented on it immediately after entering that room. As for charging time, it doesn't really take that long. Generally speaking, you can fully charge it within about 20-30 minutes.

CONS: I felt that the USB cords that came with this charger was too short. If you were to decide to set this up directly next to your PS4 console them this cord would be plenty. But if you wanted to set your entertainment center up any other way, this short little cord wouldn't allow it. I had to use a longer USB cords that I already had here at the house. 

OVERALL: I give it 4 of 5 stars. [Deduction for cord length.]

Number two: baserunning. How many major-leaguers have *you* seen running on an infield popup with less than two out?  Play this game at all, and you'll see guys who get paid more than the GNP of some small countries making that very same bonehead move.

These two very large problems are enough to really take a lot of the enjoyment out of what would otherwise be a very good game.
There are some other problems, too: the little graphic that shows where the ball (tiny white pixel), defensive players (tiny blue pixels) and runners (tiny yellow pixel that is nearly indistinguishable from the ball) is almost completely useless. The fans in the stands look like something out of a Nintendo 64 game. There's no way to skip past the incredibly awful renditions of the national anthem at the beginning of each game. The replays aren't very interesting. The commentary is wooden and nowhere near as well-done as in, say, one of the excellent NFL games. The controls are not always very intuitive or responsive (especially irritating when you're frantically pressing B to get your idiot baserunners to return to base while they blithely jog along, finally realizing that Oh! You want them to DO something!).  These are all pretty petty little quibbles, really, and none of them would be enough to really make this a bad game by themselves, but when combined with the fielding and baserunning problems, the annoyances just mount and mount until you want to chuck your controller at the TV.

always online sucks, yes they fixes the logon issue, so I can always logon without waiting. The problems I am having now is that I cannot load some of my cities at all. So many hours of work is wasted

Tourism is broken.  All the casinos and attractions suddenly lost all the customers for no explainable reasons. I have airport, rail, and ferry running, but all of a sudden people just decide not to visit.

Interactive between cities has lots of issues. Simcity try to be MMO, but they cannot do simple transactions right. Imagine that each city is a character in a MMO, and it takes 10+ minutes for each characters to exchange items/gold?  Do you want to play MMO like that?

Public transports just randomly pick and drop sims, and path finding has lots of issues. Some of the stores say no shoppers and some sims ask where is shopping, even they are right across the street. A $20 game like Cities in Motion does a lot better than Simcity in terms of path finding and transport system.

Rendering issues. Some of the buildings keep switching from invisible to visible back and forth. Sometimes when you have a quest, you get zoom in, but what you get is the back of some tall buildings because they are getting int the way.

obviously, there's no comparing this title to its predecessor, ""Resistance: FoM."" however, you'd expect a sequel to, in most -- but not all -- cases, surpass the original. unfortunately, ""Resistance 2"" doesn't just fall short of surpassing its predecessor, it falls flat on its face (although i do like the campaign/multiplayer control customization feature).

the graphics are beyond *tired*, the transitions ungraceful, with horribly unrealistic weapon mechanics -- albeit, creativity in the armament department isn't lacking -- and the storyline is linear and predictable. i was hoping this game would tide me over until ""Resistance 3"" dropped (which, in turn, was intended to tide me over until ""Battlefield 3"" dropped), but i really don't think i can handle playing it all the way through.

i couldn't help but wonder how much money was spent to get the rating quotes on the front; e.g., ""5 out of 5"" and ""9.5 out of 10."" it occurred to me that these quotes may have been completely fabricated, or that, maybe, 2008 was just a really, really bad year for game releases; i don't know as i can't remember that far back.

but, i digress...

in summation, all i can say is that i really wouldn't recommend spending money on this game. regardless of this particular letdown, i still have high hopes for ""Resistance 3."" i guess i'll just have to wait and see...

The problem that created was that after about three or four seasons I began to notice the dominant teams that signed the bulk of those players were unbeatable.  By the end of your seventh or eighth year, there were anywhere from 12 to 15 undefeated teams at seasons end. I haven't played 2005 enough to be positive that this problem has been fixed, but from just the first two seasons, it definitely appears so. There are actually upsets in 2005. That's about the only improvement I can name about 2005.

Another problem with 2004 was that all you had to do was draft a fast QB , roll out of the pocket, approach the line of scrimmage to draw in the linebackers and DB's and then heave it downfield to your single covered receiver for a 40 yard gain. I was left hoping that EA would fix the defensive AI to recognize and defend that. Did I ever get what I asked for!  Overall, 2004 worked offensively.  2005 is an entirely different story. My QB usually completes about 20 percent of his passes, and I can never rush for over 50 YPG.  Toggle the AI settings, someone suggested?  Even the worse teams will roll over my D and I still can't seem to complete a pass or run the ball, even with the defensive AI on the dumbest level.  Sometimes I can move the ball well but usually end up punting or turning the ball over in my red zone. On the highest setting, all my games end about 10-7, both teams under 100 yds total offense.  On all-american, I score all the points and accrue all the offense with Baylor while OU gets battered by my unforgiving ""C+"" Defense. When you come out of your huddle, the AI defense is ALWAYS in the right formation.  If you try to audible, the defense counters your audible before your guys even move!  So you throw a pass to a seemingly wide open receiver, here comes five supermans flying in to break up the play. You try to keep the ball on the ground, but the defensive linemen blow past your O line and are on you like stink on poop!  My favorite is when you're running a sweep or an off tackle and your FB is in front of you and you see a beautiful run developing.....only to have Willie, Mike, or Sam effortlessly run right past your FB and smack the daylights out of you ( Your FB doesn't even make an attempt to block). Or you have a great drive going and you penetrate the red zone, you get sacked 3 times and have to punt or you fumble the ball if you try to keep it on the ground.  Ridiculous!

Defensively, there were problems that were a problem in 04 but are dominant in 05.  It doesn't matter what setting I am playing on.  I can hold OU or Texas under 100 total yards of offense with the Baylor (C+) defense, while their defense holds my offense to the same figure. In my first season, I Had the #117 ranked offense, and the best defense ever to grace the gridiron of Division 1-A Football.  I held a top twenty five team (don't remember who) to -63 rushing yards and 30 passing yards on all-american. That's just not fun to me.

I have beef in other areas of the game too, but wouldn't be able to fit it here. Suprisingly, I think EA is on the right track with this one, but major gameplay problems are the hindrance.  I recently played NFL 2K5 from Visual Concepts.  A flawed game no doubt, but a good one nevertheless.  At the end of the game, all of the statistics and scores, everything, looked realistic.

This is the first Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG),  to be on any home console and I have to say it is one of the worst out there. As with any other MMORPG you create an account and pay your monthly fee. Next you create a character and log into the huge massive world. Perhaps the massive world is the only thing I liked about this game, as it was always a pure joy to just walk around and seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldy go where no other Everquest nerd has gone before! Honestly though I did find it fun and enjoyable to walk around the world. Anway, once you make your character you do missions or ""quests"" in which you complete tasks and are awarded Experience Points (XP). XP points get your character levles. Once each new level is obtained, it takes more XP to get to the next one. The advantage of getting to a higher level is that you can: 1. Wear new armor, get new weapons, kill bigger animals, and do new and repetitive quests. The max level you can obtain is 50, and to give you an idea of how long this will take to obtain Sony says the following: 500-600 hours! WOW! I can tell you for a fact that it will take around 1,000 hours for most people. In order to get that valuable XP you have to kill animals and fantasy monsters. You do so by endlessly typing into your USB Keyboard (NEEDED ITEM!) asking for a group. Once in your group, you walk to an area to kill go kill these monsters. You kill monsters by pressing the X button. Each monster takes about 20 button presses. It takes about 500 kills to level up. To most sane people this is just too much. To top it off, if you cannot find a group, you cannot kill these animals and so the game becomes usless if there isn't anyone else playing.

Garnett,"They always say, whenever another company takes over another organization they do things differently, and sometimes it is not for the best. One of them is release of Sims 3 and that EA is the one calling the shots.  I have had fun with the bug-infested game for a while, and as much as I enjoyed the game with its numerous glitches, I think about the time they with-held the game a couple months from being released to retail stores in Feburary.  For whatever reason they did that for, this game seems very un-polished, unfinished, and quickly developed.

I give EA some props, the game is good to play, when it's working, but the bugs, the glitches, and other problems with this game make it unjoyable.  The lack of things left out are numerous, and it seems like it is missing something.  I played Sims 2 for a while and realized I had more fun playing that game than I did with Sims 3.  Lots of my friends who played Sims 3, said the same exact thing, it doesn't seem like The Sims anymore, more like a water downed clone version of Maxis; The Sims 2.

This being said, I strongly urge people to wait a couple months to get the game after the updates.  You will be gravely dissapointed if you decide to buy it and install the game.  EA has a lot to do and I doubt game updates will be released anytime soon. For now enjoy Sims 2 while you can, and you might never leave that game anyways because Sims 3 is a little different. Sims 3 characters have fatter faces, look more like plastic barbie dolls that will almost resemble Ken barbie and Jen the Hologram barbies.... Building a house can be confusing to most, and sometimes your sims or npc's will do some wierd out stuff. What a nice job EA??

A big change for one, you can't create your own neighborhoods from scratch or have your other families live in the same neighborhood for some odd reason.  There is a huge bug with your families becoming automatic npc's while your playing another sims family you created.  Than they vanish before your very eyes the next time you play, maybe the game ate them for lunch?? The game likes to suck up your memory from both your video card and mem sticks and crash to desktop regardless of what high-end video card you have.  NPC's will become stuck or won't leave sometimes when you ask them to.  They will stand there forever or become stuck in some object.  Objects will look distorted in most ATI x4000 series video cards, and Nvidia 280 cards.  When you venture out of the house to a supermarket or some other places, you won't be able to see your Sims.  It is more like rabbit holes, which is a huge let down.  The list goes on but here are one of the main problems.

I give this game some positives, you get to travel outside your house without loading on instant.  You get to select many more features from your traits and your Sim developes more complicated personality.  Sims seem more in depth to how they feel to.  But otherwise noted above, if you were a huge fan of Sims 2, lets hope you will like Sims 3, because I am one of those people who will run back to the game that is more intuitive to enjoyment.  I give this game 5 out of 10 and 2/5.  I just hope EA knows what went wrong, and hopefully they will work out their technical problems within the game.

But back to the game itself I was completely disappointed with this game, the graphics are great a little not for me but still great. To look at everything is so life like you will be amaze on how detail everything is and living in new york myself I love that rockstar did their research on each part of liberty city to compare with new york city because of what you experience in the game is also what you most likely experience in new york. Also liberty city is massive in gta4 its so big it kind of annoying going to places that are so far that it might take you about 5 minutes just to reach a mission.

  I got mostly bad things to say about this game so please bare with me. To start off the music in gta4 sucks big time I means every song that they pick out is so boring and not catchy at all. Almost all the artist and their songs I do not recognize at all and whats sad is that all the stations are the same with boring music and not so funny jokes. So to be honest when I'm driving the music is always turn off which makes me mad cause I love the soundtracks they usually put in GTA but this time they fail and having it put off while driving sucks. Next is the driving its so bad its not even funny when you start driving you tell yourself ""oh this is bad but maybe I'll get use to it"", but I promise you that will never happen. The cars themselves always kinda look the same as well as drive the same which sucks cause if you want a fast car that's not going to happen and turning in sharp corners is hell making races stupid and not fun at all. I can't tell you  how many times I cuss at the tv and threw my X-box remote on the floor just cause I could not turn my car around the corner and I end up crashing into someone else or end up in the water and repeating the damn mission from the start and take ten to 15 minutes just to drive and get the mission done and pray I don't crash again.

  Another thing I hate is the story line its the worst one in the series its makes no sense and is boring as hell, missions are the same shoot, kill and drive which is fine because the shooting system is great and very fun ,the acting is great also, not one bad actor to be found. At the end of the day I stop playing the game all together because of the bad driving the story is boring and music is terrible,I'll finish it but only because of the achievements and that's it do yourself a flavor and skip it.

The Metroid series is one of Nintendo's finest, and the new entry, Metroid: Other M, is finally here. After the excellent first person Metroid Prime series by Retro was concluded, it was announced that Metroid was returning to both third person view and Japanese development. Many fans were made uneasy when it was announced that Team Ninja would be heavily involved in the project, but the fact that it was being headed by Yoshio Sakamoto, who has been heavily involved with Metroid from the beginning, gave hope that the game would live up to its classic name. Sakamoto promised that this game would flesh out Samus's character as the most story heavy Metroid yet, but has this decision ultimately backfired?

*Story*
The story is the most controversial aspect of this game. Rather than opt for the minimalist approach of the other titles in the series, Metroid: Other M inserts a full blown Final Fantasy XIII style cinematic experience. The story begins with a recap of the events that took place in Super Metroid's final moments and leads into Samus receiving a distress signal from a space station called ""the bottle ship."" She arrives to find out that the Galactic Federation has already sent a squad of soldiers, led by her old commanding officer Adam Malkovich. She ultimately joins up with them and politely agrees to follow Adam's orders.

The most jarring aspect of the story is the way it fleshes out the character of Samus.  While Samus has had spoken lines before in Metroid: Fusion, but they were never overly intrusive and didn't reveal a whole lot about her. However, in Other M, she not only talks, she talks a lot. For a series that has largely lived on letting the player form their own ideas about the character of Samus, this is a bit disconcerting.  The personality she reveals as she narrates the storyline is bound to infuriate many fans who have long seen Samus as a stoic and strong individual who is in control of her emotions.

Throughout the game, Samus has many flashbacks to her time in the Galactic Federation with Adam which portray her as an insecure little girl who has trouble handling the fact that she's a woman in a man's world. From giving a thumbs down as a salute, to her monologues about how father figure Adam is the only one who understands her, this becomes cheesy and embarrassing to watch. Back on the bottle ship Samus continues to act submissive to Adam as she instantly agrees to disable all of her abilities at his request with zero hesitation. Later on in the game, there's a scene where Samus is so frozen in fear that she is unable to do anything. Samus comes across as insecure, uncertain, and even submissive at times.

Watching the story play out, it is incredibly difficult to believe that this could be the same bounty hunter who has courageously saved the galaxy on numerous occasions. In an attempt to make Samus more human and relatable, Other M goes overboard. It's one thing to have emotions. It's another thing to be crippled by them to the point of endangering lives. For a game series that has never had a lot of story and never really needed one, I have to question why the game creators felt the need to insert this melodramatic poorly plotted mess.  The story is a major part of the game, and since you can't skip cut scenes, it is impossible to ignore.

Once you complete the game, a cinema mode unlocks where you can re-watch all of the cut-scenes strung together like a movie. Whether you'd want to is another story.

*Gameplay*
The gameplay in M:oM is also a controversial element. Other M opts to use only the Wii pointer and nothing else for control. You hold it sideways like a NES controller leaving only the d-pad and two buttons for input. If you want to fire a missile, you have to rotate the Wii remote so it is pointing at the screen, which changes the perspective to first person. This shift is rather awkward, and you can't move while you are in this view aside from an awkward dodge maneuver accomplished by quickly shifting the pointer off the side of the screen. The controls aren't broken, but they are not particularly good, either. They work, but only just.

The game itself plays more like an action game than a Metroid game. Almost all of the exploration you would expect from the series is gone, and for the vast majority of the game you are restricted to a linear path where doors will often lock behind you to prevent revisiting previous areas. There are some hidden missile expansions and energy tanks along the way, but the game pretty much tells you their exact position once you clear a room of enemies. The game only opens up to allow free exploration at the very end. This exploration makes it very clear why they decided to restrict the main story line so much, because when you have a few options of where to go, every other area is ""now loading"" for ten seconds, especially when you use the speed booster.

The combat in this game is very easy. Due to the limitations of using a digital control pad in 3d space, Other M includes a dodge move that occurs automatically when you are pressing a direction on the d-pad. This means you will almost never get hit by anything as long as you are moving around. Samus's gun also auto-aims, so most of the time you can just shoot blindly down a corridor and not worry about whether or not you hit anything. The only challenge comes from shifting to first person to fire a missile, which is only required for boss fights the majority of the time. This is more annoying and awkward than difficult, since it merely involves waiting until you have a large enough window of time to get a missile off without getting hit.

Throughout the game, Adam restricts the use of Samus's abilities until he deems them necessary, which means no more finding your abilities along the way, and also leads to illogical moments such as Adam not deciding it was appropriate to authorize the Varia suit to protect Samus from heat damage until she is already most of the way through the lava sector taking heavy heat damage along the way. This approach also means that there are no substantial new powerups for Samus to acquire. All of the significant abilities Samus has in this game are repeats from Super Metroid.

Also worth noting are frustrating sequences that involve freezing you in the first person perspective until you find some tiny hard to find object. Often you will pass the Wii cursor directly over the object you are supposed to examine without the game registering it, leading to a lot of time wasted passing over everything over and over in an attempt to find what you are meant to scan. These moments completely kill the pacing of the game.

*Replay Value*
After you complete the game, every door unlocks, and you are finally completely free to finish your collecting spree of leftover expansions. At this point, there is also an extra boss and epilogue sequence to find. However, this can all be done in less than twelve hours the first time through, and once you do, the only reason to replay the game is the hard mode that unlocks upon 100% completion. There is also a cinema mode and art gallery that unlocks. If you don't care about getting everything, a regular main story play-through only lasts around eight hours.

*Graphics*
The graphics look pretty good for a Wii game, but the actual art design is lacking. The game is filled with generic looking hallways and rooms that don't really stand out visually, and the themes never go beyond the typical generic fire, ice, and jungle areas. The only thing that stands out about them is the holographic effect that appears sometimes to remind you that these are only simulations on a space station. One high point of the visuals is that the animations are some of the most fluid I've seen on the Wii.

*Sound*
One of the most disappointing aspects of Metroid: Other M is that the game has almost no music during actual game play. The background noise consists mostly ambient sounds and, very rarely, one or two recycled tunes from past Metroid games.  Expansions are also missing the familiar tune that used to play when you picked them up in other Metroid games. This is a very disappointing aspect of the game. The voice acting is alright, but it's not spectacular. Samus sounds monotone throughout the game and you'll be hearing her a lot. The sound effects for weapons and enemies are adequate.

*Overall*

They aren't a franchise I dearly love, but it has provided me with a lot of entertainment over the years. It's always been sort of a given that when a new Halo comes out, I will buy it eventually. After this one though, I'm not sure I will continue doing so.

Visually, the game is fantastic. Very few games I've ever played match the visual quality. It's obvious great care was taken in the graphic design of everything. Likewise, the score is also amazing. It's not the usual Halo music, but it's a change that I actually like. The original Halo theme and general music is pretty much gone in this iteration, but it was very noticeable and added layers to the story. Unfortunately, when all you have in a story are layers of music, you really don't have anything.

Good lord, the story. I don't know who wrote the script for this game, but if George Lucas had a hand in it I wouldn't be surprised. There was a moment early on in the game (and I wish I could remember the line) where Master Chief responds to something Cortana says, and I had an involuntary reaction of ""Ugh."" It was that bad.

I don't expect literary genius from video games in general, and especially not in first person shooters, but this was noticeably bad. And it wasn't only the scripted dialog, it was the the way characters were written and how almost the entire plot made no sense.

The game opens with a cinematic wherein Catherine Halsey (the person Cortana is modeled after) is being interrogated by some person whom you never meet. It's a quick and very vague exchange of words that I imagine is meant to give you the impression that Dr. Halsey is keeping some sort of secret about the Master Chief. This aspect is never revisited and never pays off in any way, and you never see her again. That's okay though because the dialog was so godawful the less there is the better.

Generally the plot to the game is Cortana wakes Master Chief up out of cryostasis because she detects there are hull breaches in the aft section of the ship. I actually liked the first chunk of the game, because it was more tutorial-like and wasn't horribly padded with pointless ""You need to go here and push buttons in three different locations."" So after the tutorial you crash land on a Forerunner planet, and this is where the problems really begin. You start to receive strange transmissions that are very garbled, and come to find out it's from a UNSC ship called Infinity, who seems to be transmitting from the core of the planet. So you go to investigate.

The tracking of the Infinity and journey to the planet's core in itself isn't a problem, but after you're told why that is where the signal was coming from, everything that happened before makes no sense. It turns out that a Forerunner called the Didact is manipulating the Infinity's signal in order to fool you into coming down to investigate, and shutting down two beams of light that are garbling the signal from the ship so that you can transmit back to them. But once you do that, you inadvertently release the Didact from where he has been imprisoned for a long-ass time. And as soon as he is released his magic armor automatically appears or was already there for some inexplicable reason, even though he was imprisoned by his own people for the extreme actions he took in the past. All of that is fine and I can give it a pass, except that the Covenent are also trying to release the Didact, and you have to fight them all the way there. So...why didn't the Covenent just release him and spare Master Chief from doing all this pointless legwork for no reason? For some odd reason he also has telekinetic powers and so like the comical villain he is, he needlessly chokes Master Chief and then throws him against a wall even though he could just kill him right then since by then it must be obvious to the Didact that he has cut a bloody swath though the Covenent ranks to get this far. He also says something generic about humanity being a plague or somesuch. It was dumb and I already didn't care because it was so shallow and his motivations were so weak or unexplained.

But instead he gets in his comical bad guy sphere and flies away as his slipstream rupture makes the structure blow up real good, and for the first time in the game Master Chief survives a huge explosion, but not for the last.

Anyways I'm already sick of wasting more time explaining how nonsensical the story is. The biggest tragedy is that there is a separate story going on with Cortana and how she has been an active AI for eight years, and normal AI's begin to decay after six. This should have been the core conflict in the game. The problem wasn't that it wasn't, it's that it was done so badly that it came off and cheesy and ultimately supremely unsatisfying. There are also a couple of new characters introduced that genuinely seem interesting, but they are given hardly any chance to shine. I imagine they will be more heavily involved in the next game, but it was another aspect that was really disappointing. Instead of doing things cooperatively or in a way that allows the player to emotionally connect with them, you're forced to do mind-numbing tasks that are at least 80% ""Go here and push a button to insert Cortana into the network."" It is so dry and dull that eventually I just turned the difficulty down and began running through the sections of levels where it was possible. That's horrible to say, but I just got so tired of doing the exact same thing.

As with games like Crysis 2 or movies like Avatar, I don't care how amazing the picture or the sound is if there is no substance to the story. There is no satisfying payoff at the end. You can't just throw words out there with implied grandiose importance and expect me to care or think it's really epic. Words like Composer, Mantle, Gateway, Reclaimer, and on and on. What you're subjected to at the end is an overly forced cinematic that is supposed to be emotional (???) or something. But since it was handled in such a clunky way I wasn't moved at all (when I should have been). And then after the credits the Didact is doing narration in the past tense as if he survived the final confrontation (wouldn't surprise me) and is going to continue to be the villain. I mean if your bad guy is going to be senseless at least make him interesting, and not have him say such cliche things as ""Humanity is the single greatest threat the galaxy has ever seen,"" when in the game humanity has done nothing without being first provoked. It's just so stupid, and I shouldn't be sitting and laughing at how simplistic the dialog is in a game like this. Again, it's okay to have corny dialog in action games or movies, as long as the people working on the game or movie know that it's cheesy. When the dialog and the tone are clashing though, the player is taken out of the immersion and then has to think about why that felt so wrong. Or maybe not everyone, based on the reviews, but for me at least.

I'm really not trying to come across as that guy who is nitpicking this game to death because I hate its popularity or whatever. I'm sure if I went back and analyzed the first three Halo games and Reach you could nitpick the logic to death in those games as well. And I know that all games have busy work in them designed to pad the playing time. That's fine, but the job as developers is to disguise it in a way where you aren't constantly feeling dread every time you go to do something, knowing that it's not going to be as simple as it's planned. Sometimes it should be as simple as it's planned. It's called diversity and it's a beautiful thing.

So yeah if you're a fan of games where you get fire cool weapons at aliens and robots and don't give a damn about story or characterization in even the most basic way, buy this game. Likewise if you want it just for the multi-player, I'm sure that's good as well. If you're looking for substance though, look elsewhere.

I don't even care about the multiplayer aspect, rather the lack there of.  I am talking about the bugs, glitches, and the large universe of mediocre gameplay.  Where to start?

Bugs I have repeatedly experienced would be a good place.
1: crashing on the initial loading screen so hard that the only way I can reset the console is by unplugging it.  Holding the PS button doesn't bring up the dashboard and holding the power button does nothing.
2: landing my craft just to have it crop through the ground into an underground cave.  This usually result in a horribly maimed ship at the very least upon takeoff.
3: can't land in a meadow with some rocks on the ground beneath me but I can land on the peak of a mountain where the drop is instadeath after I run out of jetpack.
4: push R2 to take off, but it launches me into space at warp speed causing me to lose my bearings on that unmarked location I was planning to visit.  More of a nuisance than a game breaking bug, but it happens so much that it ruins ship exploration.
*Edit*
5: I, too, have experienced cropping through the ground and getting stuck.  It happened after I investigated a crash site and swapped ships.  The crashed ship's nose was cropped in the ground and after I had repaired the thrusters I hopped in the ship not realizing I hadn't repaired the engines.  Didnt have the materials on me either.  Jules out and presto, trapped below the ground and it saved that way.  I had 2 saves available though, so I had to use my earlier save to fix the issue.  Possible fix for those that  have something similar happen.

Now, for general annoyances:
1: you'll spend more time harvesting fuel resources for your shields and mining laser than you do anything else.  Who knew plutonium was such a poor source of energy and titanium was such a weak material?
2: space combat sucks.  Don't try to dog fight, you'll lose because you won't be able to keep track of the AI ships.  Just stop (as much as you can), rotate to them and shoot them as they come in for another shot, it's that easy.
3: sentinel drones EVERYWHERE.  I understand this was an attempt to present some sort of challenge, but it gets old shooting those things after a while.  Sorry I destroyed those predator creatures, but they were trying to eat me.  Now I have to deal with sentinels...
4: landing is a pain.  I usually find myself pressing square and hoping for the best.
5: can't stop your ship.  You can slow way down when you are within an atmosphere, and you can go in reverse in space, but you cannot actually stop your ship's propulsion, anywhere.  Really makes it a pain farming larger asteroids

That's a long enough list of the cons.  I shouldn't need to list of the game's potential, read the other reviews, they are basically all right in pointing out it's strong suits.  It is a fairly unique concept.  I just wonder how much they really tested this game and how they released it with the glaring bugs.  I can live with the annoyances, to an extent, but those bugs...  and anyone who plays long enough will most likely start experiencing them, whether they will admit it or not.  I get it that it's a small dev team, but they pushed it back before because it wasn't finished.

I think the only noticeable improvement is that checking seems tightened up slightly.  Aside from that, here's a list of problems:

-One timers are still near impossible to perform.  You get a two on one, make the perfect pass, and WHIFF.  Your player takes a slapshot while the puck is still six feet away.

-Positioning is ridiculous no matter how you tweak the strategy settings.  The AI is clueless on how to generate offense.  Your teammates never try to get open but instead take up awkward positions on the ice and allow themselves to be covered by defenders.  You're practically forced to take shots from the blue line and hope for a deflection or screen from traffic in front of the net.  Trying any type of cross ice pass in the offensive end is guaranteed to fail.

-Defensive positioning is equally as bad.  If the opponent fires the puck down the ice and I'm racing toward it in the corner, why do I have my own teammate directly behind me racing at it full speed?  He should peel off and head to the opposite side of the ice, not check me into the boards.

-Board play is almost always won by the computer player.  If I'm checked along the boards and knocked down, the computer player always manages to skate around me and strip the puck.  Conversely, if I check down the computer player, they somehow manage to be in the perfect position to get back to their feet and regain possession every single time.

-Lastly, and THE most frustrating issue with gameplay, is that when you're switching between players, you're frequently switched to a player either not closest to the puck and/or not in a position to make a play.  This happens at least a dozen times per game.  As an example, let's say you have possession of the puck in the offensive end and you're near the boards by the goal line.  The computer strips the puck from you.  At that very moment, you have a forward high in the slot and closest to the puck that could easily check the computer player and keep the play alive.  When you switch players, it will NOT go to that player.  It instead switches to a defenseman who is already well behind the blue line and traveling out of the zone.  This allows the opposition to now clear the zone and rush up the ice.  There are countless examples of this happening where you can either clear pucks out of your zone or keep the play alive in the offensive end and your chances are ruined because you can't switch to the player best positioned to make a play.

-HUT is an absolute joke.  I have spent hours upon hours earning coins to spend on gold packs.  I would estimate I've opened a good 20+ gold packs and I've yet to get a single player above 85.  Unless you are extremely lucky or you're willing to pay hundreds of actual dollars to buy massive quantities, there's no way for the average person to generate enough coins to complete collections.  You would literally have to play the game 24/7.

-EASHL is a step above OTP (Online Team Play) from '15, but it's still not without issues.  The ability to customize your own hockey player and to rank up is fun but the process of joining and competing as a team is a broken mess.  Drop-in games are fun, but I was hoping to join a team where I knew players would actually play their positions and work together rather than play reckless just to pad their stats.  Unless you've already established a team among your friends, trying to find a legit team among the public listings is difficult.  I've joined several and have yet to play a game as a ""team"" because nobody is ever online.

So there you have it.  The added features and depth are nice and the visuals look great but gameplay issues, the heart and soul of the game, still persist.  Until these are addressed, I'm not throwing any more money away on the NHL franchise.","More Features, Same Gameplay Issues",1447632000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

So my negative opinion of the game came after buying it, and completing the campaign, with no predisposed hostility.

Disappointment 1) The campaign was short, uninspired, and uninteresting. I guess I won't spoil anything, but it did not feel, to me, like a complete story (a la... Starcraft, Warcraft 1-3). So although I didn't care before about it only being the Terran campaign, I now do.

Disappointment 2) The battlenet system is just awful. The only people I know who love Blizzard RTS games are crazy for custom maps... RPG's, melee maps with custom units, etc... This new system disallows you from simply making/downloading a map and playing it (not to mention you pretty much can't make maps either, unless you have a master's in computer science). I won't go into the details, but suffice it to say you are stuck with a handful of boring maps on battlenet or the maps Blizzard included... and it didn't include many.

Disappointment 3) I loved Starcraft and Warcraft 2's editors. Then Warcraft 3 came and just tore those to shreds, with its ease of use and total customization power. I was expecting the next level with Starcraft 2; what I got was pretty much a gigantic excel spreadsheet full of jibberish I don't understand. Gone are the days when one could pop open the editor and add some new units or heroes to a map. Now, if doing that is still possible, you pretty much need to go to Starcraft U, and then spend several hours doing tedious crap that will get you possibly the same result as 2-5 minutes in the WC3 editor. This single issue would have led me to not buy the game, as this is my primary interest in Blizzard RTS games.

Disappointment 4) Campaigns and custom maps aside, the game is just a complete rehash of the original with less (and less fun) units. Almost as if they held back units for future releases, which is a total cop out. Firebats, medics, wraiths, and more all appeared in the campaign, so I got complacent... only to find the actual game was completely stripped down. At this point I thought ""Hmm... oh well, I guess I can just put those units back in custom maps""... oya... I can't... see disappointment 3.

So I'm pretty much disappointed about every single aspect of this long awaited game lol. I actually stopped playing it after only 4 days (yes, I completed the campaign, challenges, and played a dozen or so matches), and got the urge to start playing WC3 again (a far better, and more complete game).

I am really hoping the editor and battlenet things are addressed sometime soon, so I haven't completely given up hope; but this game does not measure up to any game Blizzard has produced in the past 16 years.",Unpleasantly Surprised,1280707200,198,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Ultimately, however, it suffers from an excess of prosaic and repetitive content, hampered by a curious absence of the exploratory and diplomatic aspects so synonymous with the Star Trek franchise.

STO remains reasonably true to the source material. Many elements and characters are pulled directly from virtually all of the television series and films, and most are used in entertaining ways. Overall, however, the quality content is too sparse and revolves entirely around combat (absent is the diplomacy, mystery, and scientific wonder of the franchise). The many random missions that monopolize the players' time is painfully rushed and pumped out by a content-generation engine that leads to mission after mission that looks the same and has the same objectives.

This rushed feeling extends to the pacing of the advancement. You will only be able to captain a new type of ship, and therefore customize and improve it, every ten levels. There are only 50 levels to advance through which means four new ships. To make things worse each ten-level stretch gets predictably longer and longer, and by level 15 it devolves into a pretty bad grind - largely due to the repetitive content. However, as I mentioned, there is some very enjoyable missions to be found within the avalanche of banality, and the space combat is well executed (even in PvP, which is rare in newly-launched MMOs). The ground (away mission) combat is, to put it simply, tedious and clearly unfinished. The ground content is so bad that you begin dreading having to partake in such missions - they serve to detract heavily from the game and make you just want to rush through them.

There is virtually no exploration in this game. Not even within your starship, which is odd for a Star Trek RPG: most of every movie and episode occured within the confines of the Enterprise or some other ship. All you ever get to see is the bridge in STO, and occassionally other portions of other ships during the terrible away missions.

Overall this isn't a bad MMO. It sways uneasily being being a good MMO, and a mediocre MMO with too many boring stretches. It does nothing to innovate or attract an audience outside of the genre, so be aware that STO is firmly set in the pre-WoW model of grindy MMO (though it is not nearly as repetitive or grindy as recent MMOs like Aion). If you really want to try a Star Trek RPG, especially a MMO, I'd say give it a shot. If you're on the fence, hold off for several months while the content gets refined and fleshed out.","Middle of the road MMO, missing some thematic traits",1266364800,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

Now that I've had a chance to play through this for a few weeks, there are a few things carried forward from earlier installments that I do not like.

Defending opponent- You are assigned one person to block on defense. At times, however, this person changes for no apparent reason. There have been times when I was assigned one person, and within about 10 seconds it switched to 2 different people! It makes things hard to follow at times. Why is this important? Because if your assigned man scores, it reflects poorly on your grade.

Grading system- It is not as bad as it was in 2k13, but it can still be unfair. You can work all game improving your score, but thanks to only a few minor mistakes it plummets like a rock. How can I be player of the game and still only earn a B- score? Something seems wrong with that!

Lack of grading system for teammates- I cannot begin to tell you the number of wide open shots, passes in the lane, or general infractions my teammates have caused/ignored. There are times when I feel like my grade should be a ""B"" or ""A"", and everyone else on the team should receive an ""F"". The game makes you feel guilty about letting other assignments score, but if you do step in and leave your assignment, you'll be punished. Catch-22! Do you want to win or do you want to play well? The two should not be mutually exclusive, although they can be at times.

__________________________ Original review below________________________________________

I own the 2k13 version and spent many hours building up my player for an amazing career. After playing a huge number of games, I gave up and shelved it.

When enough time passed, I considered revisiting 2k13 but decided to see what the latest installment had in store. Note that I had no expectations other than being at least as good as 2k13, which might have helped me avoid disappointment in a lack of additional features available on other platforms.

The two games are remarkably similar. So much so that you could put down one game and immediately start playing the other with only a few minor kinks (I did this). The shot system, defensive aspect, and graphics are the three things with the most noticeable difference.

Shot system- In 2k13 you try to release your shot at the top of the arc. The major problem with this approach is the lack of feedback other than missing. Did you miss because you held the button too long/not long enough or because you shot a 3-pointer with someone who has a zero 3 point rating? Like I said, no feedback. With the 2k15 setup, I at least know where I am releasing the button in relation to where I should. This does make it feel more like a video game than a basketball simulation, but it is after all a video game. I would probably prefer the 2k13 approach with a kinect sensor and the 2k15 with a controller. My major gripes with the 15 approach both involve the meter. Because you are trying to time your shot via the meter, you take your attention away from your character and instead focus on the meter during shots. This could lead to blocked shots, steals, or who knows what. The other issue is that it takes what seems like a long time for the meter to fill. I can imagine being called for a 24 second violation, or even worse losing the game, because I wasn't quick enough with the meter.

Defensive aspect- In 2k13, pressing one button meant you guarded a person to the best of your ability. The same is true in 2k15, but to a lesser extent. Most of the time you can get away with only one button, but it is a much more active setup. The second the ballhandler tries to run past you, the one button approach doesn't work as well as it used to. Instead your left scrambling trying to chase after the person. Right now I prefer the old system, but perhaps with time I will learn to enjoy the new one even more.

Graphics- The difference in graphics isn't mind blowing. After all, we're not switching from Nintendo NES to an N64 here. There are definite improvements in the players and things appear to be more HD than they previously were (if that is even possible). Sound records are markedly improved for this installment.

Is it a game worth playing? Once you adjust to the new shot system and learn the minor tweaks they've added like social media, this is a game that will offer many hours of entertainment. But if you want all the bells and whistles that were added to the newer, next gen systems, you're better off sticking with your older version of the game or picking up 14/15 used later.","Not so new, but improved",1424736000,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

I bought ""Darkness Within: In Pursuit of Loath Nolder"" on a whim, not knowing much about it and not expecting much from it. It definitely surprised me with some truly horrifying scenes, which I loved, but it also let me down with a horribly done story in addition to some other issues.

STORY

You take on the character of Detective Howard Loreid who has been assigned the case of tracking down the missing Loath Nolder. Mr. Nolder, who previously had been a detective, went missing five years earlier after being accused of murdering one of his own clients! While searching for Nolder, Howard is plagued with many nightmares, which distort his vision of what is real and what is not. When he starts to encounter terrifyingly weird occurrences during his investigation, he has to determine if he is going mad or if there really is a force working against him.

Although this story can sound incredibly intriguing and fascinating at the beginning, once you actually delve into the plot, which had fantastic potential, everything simply falls apart. There are so many plot lines that spring up, never to be discussed again. Also about halfway through the game, Loath Nolder is never discussed again, making it seem like you're not even looking for him anymore even though searching for him is supposed to be the main quest-it's even in the title of the game! His disappearance, like many other things, is never resolved in the game, and everything was confusing about the story the by the end, nothing made any sense whatsoever. There were so many loose ends and unanswered questions that were simply left untouched by this truly atrocious story.

Now, sometimes 360 panning can completely ruin an adventure game, making it nearly impossible to navigate and pick up inventory items; however, in this game, the panning was a fantastic element that added to the game immensely!

It really wasn't hard to find items at all, with the rare exception of a few items near the end of the game. Another thing that wasn't particularly difficult was the puzzles. They may not be solved right away, but provided you use logic and think about them, they should be very solvable.

I will confess to using a walkthrough near the last third of the game, but this wasn't because the inventory items were particularly hard to find or the puzzles were extremely challenging. I used the walkthrough because there were so many large locations with no real direction as to what you are supposed to do next, and I got a bit overwhelmed, lost, and confused.

There was a hint system in the game that was supposed to help you whenever you were stuck, but it seems that hints have only been programmed to pop up when the developers felt like you might need one. In other words, hints aren't provided throughout the game, only at certain times.

There are three main levels. The easiest has easier puzzles and more hints, the hard has harder puzzles and no hints, while the level in between has hints provided only when you go a certain time without doing the right thing and easy puzzles.

Your inventory interface contains all of the items you've collected in the game (including a cell phone which you rarely use) and a ""brain"" section. In the ""brain"" section, you can combine inventory items or ideas to create new items or ideas.

The horror element of the game was fantastic, I thought! You have the constant feeling that something is going to jump out at you, and unlike many other horror adventure games, things consistently DO jump out at you. You usually lose control of your character before anything spooky happens, but it's creepy nonetheless.

GRAPHICS/SOUND

I thought that the graphics were pretty amazing in this game! The environments may have lacked enough lighting to really see, but then again, that really added to the atmosphere of the game.

The music didn't play constantly, but when it did, it was very creepy in a mourning kind of way, and it also set the atmosphere of the game.

The voice acting was very, very good. There wasn't too much of it throughout the game, but when it was there, I thought it was well done.

OVERALL

The game definitely has a lot of pros, such as the fantastic graphics and sound, above average gameplay, and strong length (which was about 8 hours using a walktrhough for the last third of the game). Unfortunately, the horrid story, overwhelming aspects, and overall confusing nature just took too much away from the game for me.

There is a definite replay value to the game since after you complete it, you are told how many easter eggs, hidden clues, etc. you found. I had found a vast minority, and if I were to replay the game, I would definitely strive for finding the hidden areas. However, because the story made no sense and seems to change throughout the game, I'm not sure I ever will play this game again, and I'm not sure that I could recommend it for others to play.

If you enjoyed Scratches, you may very well enjoy this game; just be forewarned that the plot is absolutely horrible.",Slightly terrifying but the story makes no sense!,1304812800,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like this controller, there is a negative for every positive.  I mean that quite literally - for every good feature, that feature also has something wrong with it.  I noticed all this after only 1 day with it:
Layout - the positive is that the Rumblepad is nearly identical to the Playstation's Dualshock controller.  There are 7 buttons, 2 triggers, 2 analog sticks, a d-pad, a shift button, and even a throttle slide!  For many games, you will not need to use the keyboard when you've got this gamepad.  However, the Rumblepad is different enough from the Dualshock that if you are trying to play Playstation games on your PC (Final Fantasy, Metal Gear, bleem!, etc) you will have some relearning to do.  You might want to wait until Sony starts making USB Dualshock controllers.  (which should be in 6 months)
Feel - this gamepad is nice and big, and doesn't cramp my large (adult male) hands at all.  However, the buttons are terrible!  They are tiny, hard to press, harder to reach, and even harder to figure out which one you want without looking at the pad.  I can't simply rest my thumb naturally on the buttons, but have to bend it akwardly and press the buttons with the very tip of my thumb.  This is a design flaw of the pad, not because of my particular build, which is quite average.
Analog Sticks - these are both very responsive, and perfectly positioned.  The negative is that they don't have a good gripping surface or shape, so your thumbs don't stay centered on them.  Because the sticks are curved inwards, (console sticks on all major systems are curved outwards) I often find I am controlling the stick by its very edge, which is uncomfortable and very inaccurate.  As if by the Hand of God, you usually won't need to repositon your thumb until you reach a particular important part of your game!
USB - this speaks for itself.  USB is great, if you don't know yet.  You can unplug the pad and move it off your desk easily.  However, this gamepad requires a -powered- USB hub.  You can't plug this into your keyboard USB ports.  Great if you already own a powered hub, but if you don't that means you either spend another $ on one, or you plug it into the back of your computer case (thus defeating the ease of USB)
(as of Oct 2000, the Rumblepad doesn't work well with Windows ME.  I downloaded the latest update from Logitech, but my computer locks up whenever I plug the gamepad in.  I have to have my computer off to plug it in.  However, this might be caused by the power requirements of the Rumblepad, not the software.)","Good, but Not Great",971568000,31,,

To get really the only 'bad' out of the way, instead of near the end, I will say this mouse feels cheap. It feels a little hollow, light, and on the average side of size. It feels like a 15$ mouse. Is this a big deal? Not really given the price is less than 50$, however I did expect a little more quality. In that regard, Logitech has always produced quality products. In this case, the quality is below my expectations.

This mouse is for those who want a mouse to perform just the basic uses such as clicking but also have the capabilities to to deliver precision fast response. You will basically get no extra buttons to do anything with. The side forward and backward buttons can be programmed. That's...2. The DPI toggle buttons can too however, you will then not have the DPI buttons available.

This uses an optical device that performs very well on any surface I put it over. The response rate was instant and there was no lag.

The plastic on top of the mouse seems like it would wear with time, but is decent for grip.

The scroll wheel feels more sturdy then other comparable mice I have used, and the sensitivity is superior. There are 4 stages in sensitivity with a button that will default back to 800 dpi so that you can instantly revert back to normal movement. The sensitivity alone does not make this the absolute best choice for a gaming mouse in its price range, because for 10 or so dollars more; there are better options.

For shape, it is a standard Logitech mouse.

I would not really recommend this to a gamer that likes many buttons for quick access. If what you want is a very fast responding wired mouse (I could not tell a difference personally between this and any other one I have used before e.g. G700 or G7 which has 5700 dpi--which is a good thing) then you are getting a fairly sensitive one here with 3600 dpi and a low ms USB connectivity.

Really, in the final analysis, you are paying for a standard wired mouse equipped with a good optical and good connection. This is advertised as the bottom end of Logitech's wired gaming options. If you are contemplating purchasing this mouse, then you know what this does not have. However, it does not feel well made, as compared to Logitech's other brands.

This is one of the better functional mice of Logitech's lineup in the price range. If you need to have a mouse under 50$ for gaming, this is it. You can not get the quality of optical, DPI, and button longevity that you would get with the G400.

If you want to spend a little more then I would highly recommend another Logitech mouse:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-G500-Programmable-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B002J9GDXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech G500 Programmable Gaming Mouse</a>&nbsp;which has 5700 dpi and programmable buttons.

3.0,False,"01 2, 2007",A1HX04JEY9MR3,B000GJ0J1A,C. Bakehorn,"The Nintendo Wii isn't even two months old, yet many gamers including myself have gotten a grasp on which types of games play well and which ones don't play so well. So far, the first-person shooter genre has been the target for a lot of controversy; some Wii gamers love stuff like Call of Duty 3 and Red Steel while others complain that the games are unplayable. I fall into the former category, and thus decided to give Ubisoft Montreal's Wii iteration of the Far Cry series a shot. Far Cry: Vengeance has its ups and downs but altogether is the most playable Wii shooter yet.

Far Cry: Vengeance won't win you over with its story. Jack Carver gets caught up with a busty arms dealer named Kade who gets him into all sorts of trouble with a crazed madman named Semeru, his mercenaries, the military, and a man in charge named Kien Do. I've never really liked Carver, even in the series' 2004 PC debut. Vengeance does nothing to change that, with poorly constructed cinemas and the worst voice acting since...well, Elebits, which came out the same day. I'll just say that December 12th, 2006 marked the day of all days for awful voice acting. As a result, I couldn't find myself caring much about the story and just wanted to shoot some thugs in the jungle.

Far Cry: Vengeance uses familiar Wii shooter mechanics but does everything better and smoother. Aiming around the screen works well and the aiming/turning ""box"" feels more natural here than in Red Steel or Call of Duty 3. Ubisoft Montreal added an extra helper by letting the player prevent the camera from turning by holding down the A button. This allows for super-precise aim and severely limits missed-shot frustrations. Jumping with the nunchuck (flick up) works well, and I personally think that reloading (C button) is much more natural than flicking (Red Steel) or pressing the super-small Minus button (Call of Duty 3). I can't say enough how much more I enjoyed playing this game just because of its intuitive controls. Ubisoft Paris and Treyarch, grab some paper and take notes

There are definitely a lot of guys to shoot, too. I am somewhat disappointed, generally speaking, that Ubisoft Montreal went away from the original game's stealth-centric style. This style, which forced the player to scope out an upcoming area with binoculars to pinpoint enemy locations and other points of interest, took more time but ultimately provided more depth. Far Cry: Vengeance is much more run-and-gun, which is still pretty fun, but admittedly shallow. As I said, there are a lot of mercs in the lengthy single-player campaign to shoot. There are also a lot of guns to use, like standard pistols and submachine guns as well as high-powered sniper rifles, chain guns, and rocket launchers. The guns are all pretty useful in their own unique ways; the pistol isn't too weak and thus is handy throughout the game while the sniper rifle allows the player to stay back and pick off thugs from afar. You'll also drive vehicles like ATVs, patrol boats, and licensed Jeep trucks (strange use of licensing, but whatever), but after a while I preferred to walk and shoot because the vehicles didn't handle as easily as they should.

Jack's predator powers, which were made familiar in the Xbox release, Far Cry: Predator, are put to good use in Vengeance. By killing a lot of enemies and busting skulls with headshots, Jack will fill up a Predatorine meter that allows him to utilize some of his powers. Jack initially unlocks a super-fast running speed that can be activated by holding down the A button. He also has a health-regenerating power, done by flicking the nunchuck to the left and the right. This was obviously the most useful power throughout the game. Soon afterward, Jack will be jumping 20 feet into the air, using enhanced senses like sight and smell, and climbing up walls with his bare hands. The predator powers are all a lot of fun to use and open up the gameplay for more possibilities. For example, there's a sequence about halfway through the game where a player is running across bridges and through the jungle surrounded by snipers. One could either take it slow and pick off the snipers with his or her own rifle or run and jump at mad speeds through the entire area to avoid their gunfire. I personally took the latter approach in this given situation 1) because I'm an awful sniper and 2) I was running low on health and didn't have enough Predatorine to regenerate my health manually.

Unfortunately, not all is smooth sailing. Despite my enjoyment of most of the game, I'll gladly tell you that Far Cry: Vengeance looks like piss. It is easily the worst-looking ""next-gen"" game I've ever seen. Nintendo can walk the ""gameplay over graphics"" line all they want, but when visual factors look like they came from the Nintendo 64 (textures) or Dreamcast (character models) era, the line has been crossed. I'm really not being sarcastic, satirical, or unfair: this is a pretty awful-looking game. The frame rate doesn't even hold up very well in some sequences, either. I've seen bugs like enemies walking into walls and tree bases floating three or four feet above the ground. What happened to the dynamic lighting and water effects, detailed character models, and pretty cinemas? What's the deal, Ubisoft? The Wii is clearly capable of visuals that are better than this. Look at games like Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Rayman: Raving Rabbids, hell, even Red Steel  This is an embarrassment. Other than feats like an impressive amount of vegetation, large levels, and the fact that the game runs without freezing, there isn't much to compliment. I'd have much rather had small levels with better graphics and effects.

The sound effects aren't much better, but they work. The music is appropriate for the surroundings, but I found it odd that intense jungle beats would sometimes play while I was simply strolling through the harmless jungle, far away from any sort of threat. And what's with the insults? Ubisoft Paris threw shockers like ""Moron "" at me with Red Steel, and I'm still hearing ""Coward "" in Far Cry: Vengeance. What's the deal? This is an M-Rated game made in 2006. I'm not asking for gracious, unnecessary amounts of derogatory swearing, but when a man is jumping 20 feet in the air towards me about to dice me up with a machine gun, the last thing I'm going to yell is, ""You are afraid of me ""

There are a few factors that will ultimately determine whether or not you enjoy Far Cry: Vengeance. First, do you like how Wii shooters handle? Second, do you like run-and-gun shooters with little to no required strategy? Third, are visuals and sound effects important in any way, shape, or form? If you answered yes, yes, and no, you'll agree with me when I say that Far Cry: Vengeance is an enjoyable game, if not a great game. Otherwise, you'll say, ""This game plays as poorly as the others,"" ""This game is shallow and stupid,"" and ""This game looks like dog crap,"" respectively. Think about it clearly: Vengeance has great shooter mechanics and a fun campaign but almost totally lacks any impressive superficial values whatsoever.","A far cry from pretty, but nails fun right on the head.",1167696000,38,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

3.0,True,"12 4, 2013",AMZCQIDUWDHLC,B00002SVET,John. N,"A few months ago I picked up a copy of Donkey Kong Land III at a local game store and had a pretty enjoyable time making my way through the game. Because the titles that make up the GameBoy Land trilogy are so inexpensive these days - and given that I'm much more taken with retro games than current ones - I wanted to make an effort to try out the other games in the series. Long story short this is another solid game to add to any GameBoy collection... but unlike Land III the original game isn't quite as smooth in what it offers.

One of Donkey Kong Land's greatest strengths is while it contains the same gameplay as the Super Nintendo games, the level design is not directly ripped from those titles. This might seem like an odd thing to champion (and you really need to play the rather disappointing Donkey Kong Land 2 as a point of comparison to know why I'm stating this) but this makes the proceedings feel fresher than they would otherwise be. The importance of this comes into play late in the game when the player enters the final world (the city levels) which is unlike anything in the SNES trilogy. Ironically this is where the game almost falls apart. These levels are home to a rather significant difficulty spike and while it's kind of welcome (since the Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo is ridiculously easy) it puts an obvious strain on the experience. Additionally, the controls and character physics in Donkey Kong Land take some time to get use to. Donkey Kong and Diddy don't handle exactly like they do on the Super Nintendo. Jumps are much more ""floaty"" in this version and the Kongs move through the water with much less resistance. This will definitely throw players off at first but thankfully they will adjust and be able to compensate very quickly.

However, beyond that there really isn't anything else that holds Donkey Kong Land back. The game is an inexpensive and is easy to come by since the Land series games were produced in a pretty robust quantity and become part of Nintendo's Player Choice line-up.

In theory, this is a great idea. In practice, the controller feels cheap, the buttons are click but feel cheap, and overall just feels like worse quality than the normal XBOX One controller, which isn't that great either. (I am using this with XB1). However, it does work; and to its credit, it has not broken or shown any signs that it will break in the few days I have been using it. The buttons always seem to be responsive for me and so I have to give it credit there. But with a game that relies so much on buttons that will last a while and not break, I do have my doubts about this controller. I do like the way it looks and feels in the hand, except for how light and cheap it feels. I am not an expert Mortal Kombat player so maybe this was geared towards someone who is willing to sacrifice some controller feel for lightness.

The thing with Mario Party 2, is it didn't do much to improve on the first. It detracted, in fact. The games this time around aren't half as great, and that's when you're playing them. The board play is slower than ever with all the crapola they've loaded on to them this time. I'm sorry, themes and getups worn by characters don't count as innovative, or new.
Another little thing. The different minigame that's played is decided based on the colour square you land on. More often than not, my brother and I found ourselves stuck in a 3vs1 minigame, which, cooincidentally, has the least amount of games in it. I can't tell you how many times I've played Look Away.
Hopefully, Nintendo will do something to improve on the game, when they're making Mario Party 3. If they're going to go at it like they did 2, then they'd best not even bother.

This isn't a bad game, it's just merely okay, which is disappointing for a Resident Evil game.  As I progressed further into the game, I was hoping for more diversity in the enemies, and maybe just a little more combat.  Instead you get the exact same monsters throughout the entire game.  No zombies, no hunters, no dogs, no Ganados, no soldiers, or anything with any kind of personality.  Personally, I found ""The Evil Within"" to be a much better successor to the Resident Evil series than this.

Yes, we were a bit worn out with all the ""Call of Duty"" style action of RE6, but it seems they could have had some balance.  RE4, arguably the pinnacle of the series, had a great balance of combat and exploration.  Once you finished that game, you wanted to start over and play it again.  Sure, you can replay RE7 and try to get bigger and better guns, but for what?  There really isn't that much combat to make it worth it.

I wouldn't recommend paying the full FIFTY BUCKS for the special version. It only has 6 videos of actual US naval films, the rest is advertising for manuals and DVD's, not to mention the narration by a guy who sounds like he's 15.

It also doesn't include the full guide to the enemy vessels you will be facing. Not a whole lot of bang for your buck. It's a real shame that I can't give this game 5 stars, but it just doesn't feel done. I really wished that Ubisoft would of held off until all the bugs could be worked out. I even e-mailed them on it, but they just didn't listen.

It's not a horrible game. In fact, I'd suggest you go out and get it, that is if your PC can handle it. Again, I don't think you should buy the unfinished special edition version. With their promised future patches, I'd say this will be a 5 star game... but that will be told in time.

I am a fan of racing, including Nascar, but I find myself fast forwarding races instead of watching the full events these days. Simulation games are just as boring to me. Similar to golf, it would be more exciting if I was there in person or participating myself. That said, this looked like a goofy racing game.

It IS a goofy racing game, but it's also riddled with problems. The controls are simple, but the AI is annoying at best. It's built in for AI to catch up if left behind and it's more and more difficult to stay in the lead as the computer players tend of fly up behind you and smash you into barrel rolls or obstacles. The game is relatively easy, as are most of the achievements. Most you will achieve just by finishing races. There are not that many races and this game should be an easy 1000 GS to anyone playing it.

Racing game fans will not enjoy it, however. The physics are not great, even for an arcade game. I guess I just expect a lot out of games these days, but it's really not a good game.

Computer Specs
------------------------
Intel Core i7 860 @ 2.80 GHz, 8 gig RAM, Radeon HD 5850

Documentation
------------------------
I actually enjoy reading the manual for a new strategy game. Digging into how the game works encourages thinking about how to approach the game. The manual for Empire is definitely under developed. It covers some basic 'how tos', but not much else. I couldn't find information on basic game mechanics, such as how the economy works. This is a moderately complex game so the documentation should cover the mechanics of play, otherwise making intelligent choices is difficult. Fortunately there are many helpful guides on twcenter.net and the official Empire: Total War forum.

My Game Setup
------------------------
Austria-long campaign-medium / medium difficulty.
The long campaign is from 1700 to 1799, two turns per year. A 50 year campaign is also available. The two standard campaign types awards you a victory if you meet some conquest objectives. There is also a prestige campaign where you try to build up the most prestige. These are points awarded for military conquest, research, and some other criteria.

The Early Game
------------------------
The first 30 turns or so were interesting. Making the choices of what to research and how to develop my regions was enjoyable. The battles stayed somewhat small (less than the full number of units one general can manage) so they didn't take very long.

The Mid and End Game
----------------------------------
Once my empire started to grow the game became more tedious. Empire doesn't present information in a very usable way for empire management. Research choices become a hassle because it is tedious to collect the relevant information. Do I improve the metal working or the pottery techs? Well, I would like to know how many of each building my empire has in existence, whether they are prosperous, how much money they make, etc. There is no empire summary screen to see this information. You must either scroll around the map counting or use the arrows to jump to each town one at a time. Either way isn't ideal. If there is a more useful method, please let me know.

The battles...
------------------------
To me the battles stayed interesting when they were on a small scale, such as 3 to 10 units per side. After that they became more of a chore to me. Obviously this is just a matter of opinion and if you enjoy the battles more than I do you probably will enjoy the game much more than myself.
I also found the same basic tactics worked for me the entire game. In general I could set up my units in the corner of the deployment area. Usually I would have a modest amount of artillery (1-3 units). I would protect the arty with line infantry and have same cavalry to help mop up. I don't remember losing any battles during the campaign, but I do think I lost one or two.
It seems like the AI usually brings the battle to you even when you initiated the attack. This let my defense technique described above work. When he was vastly outnumbered he tended to hang back, but if the forces were close in number he was usually the aggressor.
The AI does not do a decent job attacking a fortification. It does use artillery to soften up the fortress to create some holes, but with some well placed units you can defend your fortification even if you are vastly outnumbered. His troops usually don't all arrive at the same time, so you don't need to handle a massive attack all at once.

I only had one naval battle in my campaign since I stayed focused on Europe.

Diplomacy and Relations
-----------------------------------
I am not going to describe in detail how diplomacy works, but I thought there was a good number of tools you can use to manage your relations with other countries (you can exchange technologies and regions, open trade routes, make alliances, etc). The reasons for a good or poor relationship was detailed nicely in a tool tip for each country. There were a couple things I found odd.
Countries seem to forgive your territorial expansion pretty quickly. I had mine up to a -40. When I looked at it again, it was in negative single digits. I did play fairly aggressively, conquering half of the Ottoman Empire right from the start. When Prussia and Poland-Lithuania attacked me, their lands were added to Austria's growing mass.
Also, when you do not honor a treaty when an ally is attacked it seems like it angers your former ally no more than other countries. A greater penalty with your former ally would make more sense.

The Visuals
------------------------
I think Creative Assembly did a nice job on the map. It is pleasant to look at and the information is pretty clear. You can view natural choke points pretty well. To me it was occasionally difficult to notice where an army's route could be blocked by terrain. The waypoint for units is color coded, so you can see how many turns it will take for the unit to get to its destination. Region borders are color coded so you can see if you border with an enemy, an ally or a neutral country. I would have liked it if it were easier to pick out my country's border as a whole. You can use the mini map to see this, but something on the campaign map would have made it a little easier.
The battle visuals are nicely done. The units have good detail to them, the terrain looks nice, and the smoke effects add some character to the battles.
There were a couple of battles where the frame rate dropped to a crawl. As I mentioned above, my specs are pretty good and I didn't have my settings maxed. This rarely happened, but when it did it was pretty bad.

Summary
------------------------
Stronger documentation would have been much appreciated. A player shouldn't be required to seek information from 3rd parties for basic game mechanics. An enjoyable early game gives way to a tedious mid to end game. The last 50 turns I turned off viewing the AI moves and hit next turn constantly. I was so far ahead I wasn't motivated to play beyond reaching my objectives. I was bored of the battles, so I didn't want to slog through any more. In fact I did auto resolve the battles once I had an overwhelming force.
It doesn't appear that each country provides a substantially different experience, but that is just a guess. I think playing a naval country like England would be very different from Austria, but beyond that I think the experiences would be similar. I actually have a thread asking more experienced players about this, so I may be wrong. I think if you enjoy the battles more than myself you can get a lot more replay out of this game.

Overall score (1 to 10): 6
-----------------------------------
I don't regret the time I spent with it, but I don't feel terribly inclined to play again.

The graphics are tremendously well done, the interface is enhanced while still utilizing the layout that we're familiar with - one nice update is that unit information is more readily available. I've only played thru the prequel, but so far everything from formation buttons to unit AI seem like an improvement.

One great difference from the original Rome TW is that you do not have to complete a successful campaign as Rome in order to unlock the playable factions. You can jump right in as a barbarian horde.

**Update**

Well, as stated before I had only played thru the prequel. Now, having technically played about 14 hours of gametime, some unfortunate truths have come to light. I say technically because that 14 hours was probably more like 8-10 of actual gaming.

As the game progresses, more or the map exposed, more factions encountered, etc, the game becomes something of a bloated mess. I literally end my turn, walk away and go fold laundry or something. With luck, no decision moments have come along - like any one one of the 30+ factions asking for a non-aggression pact or trade agreement. Otherwise I answer it and go back to household chores.

The level of agression is also much lower than in previous games. It works in your favor since you have to have a general to recruit troops, which minimizes the amount of armies running around, and the garrison troops are actually respectable, but you can't recruit a few quality troops to keep an eye on things. You also can't recruit replacement troops to send to the front without recruiting a new general to deliver them or sending your current general back to get replacements. Unfortunately it makes the game uninteresting strategy wise. You don't need to commit troops to defense - nobody is likely to attack your big, profitable, practically unguarded city.

The upside: It's a beautifully rendered game to look at, managing construction by province is a plus, and the game reminds you if you've forgotten something at the end of the turn (no more missing technology research)

The downside: Battles seem like a free for all, Faction AI is unaggressive, provincial management overall is unclear - especially managing happiness, and you can only have one agent per army. One big peave is you can only research one technology at a time - I think one technology research slot per completely controlled province would be reasonable. That makes technology development slow and largely irrelevant.

Dealbreaker: Clicking the ""end turn"" button is great for household chores or reading your mail, but you quickly become disenfranchised with waiting several minutes between turns.

Now, before you all jump on me because I don't own one yet, I used to feel the same way, i.e. why bother to write about something you don't even have yet, etc, and used to berate people for that myself, until someone on here made (what I think to be) an excellent point--this is a review of your experience with the item and opionion on it, so if you have USED it for a time, you are entitled to give your view, even if you don't have one in your house yet. I still stand by my previous disdian of people that ""review"" things but have never actually seen or used them  though :0)

Also I want to say again I'm NOT a ""fanboy"" I own, and like equally, a PS2, a 360 and an original XBOX. Truth be told when I have time to play games, I probably spend most of my time, still on the PS2, and quite a bit on the 360 (just got a bunch of new games for it) but I have a big XBOX library too. As a PS2 gamer I was very excited to see the new system, because I know I will buy one, eventually; I just needed to decide if it was going to be NOW.

So, there's my ususal boring intro-as for the ""review"" I was able to spend a few hours on various demo units and really liked a lot of what the system has to offer. I like the fact it will play many of the games I already own. I like the fact that they didn't change the controller radically as far as shape or layout, but the ""motion movement"" or whatever it's called, and the missing rumble are hard to get used to. The graphics look great, but, I don't have an HDTV and don't really see a reason to get one right now, so as with my 360, games will look good, but not like on a HDTV. An HDTV is another thing I want, eventaully, but its a matter of do I NEED it now? No.

A lot of people make a big deal that there are only a few PS3 format games out; that's always the case with new systems. In 6 months there will be plenty. I only got my 360 in August (so I could play Saint's Row, lol) and in the months that passed since the 36o was launched several good things happened (1) there was a dependable supply so it was easy to pick one up (2) there were many more games in the format available (3) you didn't have to worry about getting shot, lol. Besides as many have pointed out, gaming is only one function of the PS3; it can be used as a HD DVD player, media hub, etc, so you will get a lot of use from it until GTA4 is out.

I didn't like the interface. I didn't like the fact that the PS3 can not read the old memory units. (it can use almost any other kind of card or stick though, at least the 60gb version can anyway-it has a multi card reader) I can't see this console, right now, coming anywhere close to the on line experience the 360 has, in both ease of use and varied content, although, over time of course they will probably be more similar, and, Sony's service is free-XBOX live is subscription based. I think both the 360 interface and on line are much better, though. The last thing I didn't like was, it is very big and bulky, for a console. I already have a 360 an XBOX and a PS2 (the old fat version from 2000 not the one they have now), so I am already tight for room I have to unhook, say my PS2 to hook up the 360 when I want to use it. There's no room on my desk for the PS3. Wish they made it smaller. But I guess when I get my HDTV I'll get one of those big TV racks.

To finish up, if you have an HDTV I would recommend the PS3, but I would still wait about 6 months until the supply issues have been hopefully improved. If you don't have HDTV it's really not worth the money. HD DVD's do have WOW factor, but they aren't mass market yet. And lastly you should NOT in my opinion pay one penny over retail. That's just insane.","Very good....but I would pass, for now",1165968000,15,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

Your baptism of fire begins during the Pearl Harbor raid, and continues with the island hopping campaigns all the way to Japan herself. Dozens of aircraft are made available in order to accomplish different types of missions.

Graphics: I have found that just about anything made by UbiSoft looks great. Being a big WW2 history buff, especially the air wars, I was absolutely blown away by the awesome quality of the planes, islands and ocean. Explosions were awesome, as were smoke trails left by wounded fighter planes, and water and light effects. Load screens are kinda nifty, in that they look like 1940's movie, military and propaganda posters. Nice touch that adds to the ambiance and flavor of the game.

Sound: Mostly you hear the noise of your fighter's engine, sporatic radio traffic, and the blasts made by your guns and bombs. The sound gets a tad monotonous after a while, as does the inane radio chatter between pilots and ground troops.

Playability: Again, being a history buff, I was excited to play this. Controls are tricky at first, but they are not difficult. My biggest complaint is pretty much the same one I have with most fly-and-shoot games. It seems that YOU are the only pilot in the sky, and you have to perform about 5 tasks at the same time to complete the level. Example: on level 2, mission 3, you need to protect an admiral's staff car while he is being chased  by enemy jeeps, while protecting an airfield from enemy dive-bombers, while engaging enemy fighters, then making sure a flying-boat doesn't get shot down, while fending off a sea-borne assault, while defending a cluster of coastal defense guns! WHEW! Where are all of the other friendly fighters doing? Come on...

Overall: You may want to rent this one first. Frankly, I was let down. I was excited by this title, but like most console-based flyers, this one was kinda lame. Another example: An American squadron of Navy F2F Wildcat fighters gets jumped by a Japanese squadron, and you are there to render assistance. The US pilots are low on fuel, and you have only a limited time to save their bacon. Sounds great, right? WRONG! Turns out the enemy fighters are Japanese bi-planes with floats!

Now that I have quite a bit of time with this controller,  I found this controller just ok. I can't tell if the left stick is off too but aiming arrows with the right stick is quite tricky. I purchased this when Zelda Breath of the Wild came out because I know how long the gamepad's battery life is (not long at all) and I knew I was going to try to marathon that game, especially at first. Aiming with the gamepad, even without the gyro controls, is nice and smooth. The right stick is very accurate and not overly sensitive or too stiff.

This is NOT the case with this controller. Aiming with the right stick takes some serious practice/patience. It is way too stiff and overly sensitive when you finally get it to move. It makes using your bow and arrow kind of frustrating. I'm a sniper gamer at heart so I use bow and arrows a lot.

Everything else is fine. All other buttons are responsive and the battery life is my favorite part. It lasts for a really, really long time.

Its 2010 and still know other game with the John Woo name I'm guessing he wasn't so pleased with the sales of this game. Just stick to the films John, But I applaud him for trying.

The game is a 3rd person shooter similar to Max payne, Dead to rights and whatever other game that has you playing as a cop and slo mo is involved. There is a story but it feels rushed and its just there for the sake of having a story that can be a ""sequel"" to John Woo's action classic ""Hard boiled"". This should be an early warning sign to how everything would turn out. Making a sequel to a movie in a video game format it would of worked here if better thought out and executed. What you get here is level after level shooting enemies after enemies. Now you saying so you did the same thing in Max Payne; true but Max payne back in 2000 was the first of its kind and paved the way for other shooters such as Dead to rights, matrix etc.

The game games gets old after a while, the pacing is the same from start to finish and there's boss fights which are just enemies with more health and bigger guns shouting at you and some turret shooting just to add variety. But you know that the game is just trying to hard when adding those. But the John Woo factor kicks in once in a while which are the cutscenes which look really good and are worthy of the John woo title, its like your watching one of his film but in video game form which you don't get to control.

The production values high there's know doubt about that, they went to great length to make everything in the game destructible, just like Woo's films you need to have a place riddled with bullets and you get a lot of that here. Now the game is short you can probably beat it in one sitting and there's some bonus materials to unlock like art, videos etc. And there's a competitive online multiplayer which is fun for a while but you won't find anyone playing.

3.0,False,"12 19, 2012",A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B007BGUGVO,Christopher Barrett,"Two big problems:

One.  You cannot use the stick to aim shots while in the close up view.  You must tilt the actual 3DS to aim shots.  With the 3D turned on, this is a nightmare.  And it's not very accurate.  Plus, the game auto runs your player.  Letdown...  You have to use the overhead view for the ability to fully control your player as well as aim your shots.

Two.  All the neat swag you unlock can only be used by your 'Mii' character.  So you can't change out equipment on the Mario Bros characters.  This makes it kind of pointless to unlock and buy equipment if you are someone like me that enjoys walloping people with Boo or Diddy Kong.  The developers could have had each of the Mario characters come with their standard equipment already and then have the ability to change the standard equipment out.  Like Mario Kart 7.  Alas...

Another interesting and wonky thing is that you can't set a stable camera angle even in the 3/4 perspective.  The camera rocks and tilts and moves sporadically, creating a headache of a view angle.  Plus, the 3D is not really very good in this game, so you don't really get the effect of the shots in proper 3D.  I actually turned the 3D down after several hours.

The gameplay is not true tennis by any stretch.  You basically make contact with the ball in any fashion and the game compensates.  The only time it doesn't is when you are late in hitting and the ball hits your player instead.  The trick to winning is to use shots that are effective against the shots your opponent hits.  Standing in the colored 'special' circles gives that effect to your shot.  For example, if the blue squid lights up in the circle, run to the circle and power up a shot.  The shot then gives a huge arcing shot that is more difficult for the opponent to hit.  Fire flowers, stars, mushrooms, and bob-ombs all give different effects.

The best and most interesting part of this game is the ability to 'play' the original Super Mario Brothers by hitting the screen with tennis balls.  It's weird and strangely addictive.  Plus, it gets tough.  Especially at first when you are looking at the screen you're attacking and not really controlling your player that well.  I found that most of the time when I lost was when I was trying to do something and completely forgot to hit the ball with my player.

Multiplayer is good, but with the style of gameplay it can be frustrating.  It is a setup that makes it so that even newbies can play effectively against veterans.  As long as they keep hitting X (regular shots), and getting into the special circles, they can present a challenge.  I also found that it is stupidly easy to get back into position for tricky shots.  For example, if I hit a long shot and then drop a slice over the net on my next shot, the opponent usually gets up to catch the shot  despite being miserably far back in the court.

It's a decent game and it's fun.  But there are quite a few tweaks the developers could have made to improve it.  More camera angle options would have been a good start.  Then the ability to change Mario Bros character gear.  And perhaps improved the scale of the players to the courts making it a bit tougher to reach out of place shots.  It's a game with training wheels (at least in tournaments and matches - not as easy on the option when you play SMB1), it seems aimed at a younger crowd.  And usually I dig games even if they are aimed at younger audiences, but this is one that I think could have been a lot better with more options and settings.  Perhaps we can get a Mario Golf game soon with some more depth.  In the meantime I will be playing Mario Kart 7.

Of note:  I've heard this is mostly material from Mario Tennis 64.  I will be checking into this, I never actually played it on my N64, but judging by the screen shots, it looks very similar with the exception of some characters and the SMB1 mini game.  Perhaps one could download it on an emulator to see if that is the case...

Introduction
Bioware developed the first Kotor for xbox and pc a Star wars epic That Microsoft should do an hd remaster of no Offense for xbox one
Bioware wanted to work on something new so Obsidan got the chance to make a followup

the problem is the characters and plot

you are a Jedi that has been exiled Fantastic after spending all that time focusing on revan and the last story lets throw it out the window for a generic Jedi no one cares about

who takes like 13 hours to get his lightsaber and be a jedi
whos actions Are pointless

the characters are Generic ripoffs of the last  Game

Example

Kriea is malik
Atton is carth
Mandolore is canderous
etc

The problem with these characters is this they lack character

I knew kreia was a villain the moment I Answered the opposite led to her dislike of me and I started moving toward the light side

The exile is not allowed back into the order which is dumb the jedi seem to have no intrest in keeping a watch on him and have disappeared all this comes off rushed and makes the jedi look dumb and the exile incredibly nave

The planets also are more boring this time Malacore 5 is great as is doesn't make up for korriban what happened why was korriban included except for the  cave sequence

why is atton and the crew so dumb

how does no one figure out kreia's plan its incredible stupid everyone says kreia is complex no shes  not shes a villain who acts like a hero and tricks everyone into being her tool its incredibly dumb

And why Are bastilla carth and malak in this piece of crap it just ruins the chance to tell a new story who wrote this story Theres three jedi all of which are interchangeable Vrook and the nar shadda jedi are the same character

Atris is the only compelling character here and no one else except handmaiden and bao dur

1. The words are explained but there are no examples that show how to use them. As a result, you can create non-natural English sentences even though you know their meanings.

For example, ""influx"" is explained as ""the arrival of large group of people or things"". That's it. There's no example. This is just like learning new words by memorizing an English dictionary which is next to useless. It's because you won't be able to create correct English sentences. Further more, it's very difficult to remember them without good examples.

In this area, this game is far more inferior to Collins Cobuild-advanced Learners English Dictionary, paper back, ISBN 978-0007210121. It has multiple examples for every term. One of the examples for influx is ""The increase of 4.5 million in America's foreign-born represented the largest immigrant influx of any decade in US history""

2. There's no pronunciation! English is a living language. You might know the words but other people won't understand what you're speaking if you pronounce them wrong! Again, In this area, this game is not as good  Collins Cobuild-advanced Learners English Dictionary. It contains a CD with pronunciation of all the words it explains.

3. The interface is good in many areas but it's difficult to use in ""Missing letter"" game. Here, you have to spray painting to fill in the missing letter. Wii controller is the wrong tool for this. Many times, I just finished spraying part of a letter A when the game recognized it as ""I"". It's very frustrating because I had to erase it and start it all over again. That made me exceed the time limit.

I've got some really mixed feelings about Infinity.  They're as much of a money grab as Skylanders is - never expand an existing set, just keep putting out whole new ""master"" sets that you have to get if you want to continue.  My second complaint is that driving a vehicle in Infinity is, to put it mildly, insanely frustrating.  It's nothing like driving something that's WELL done, like Mario Kart, or Sonic All Stars Racing.  Driving in Infinity blows chunks.  I've hated it every time it's come up.  So I really was afraid this was just going to be more of the horrible controlled vehicluar frustration.

And it was.  Granted, it's a LITTLE better than the standard driving is, but it's still just as awful for ""feel"" while driving.  Drifting is really just an intermittent thing.  Sometimes it isn't horrible, other times it really just stinks.  You can go into the same turn at the same speed with the same car and character and one time it's better, one time it's worse.  And the car really just seems to pick random directions sometimes to go in if you hit a wall.  Nothing more frustrating than suddenly finding yourself going at a right angle, or worse, the wrong way, after bumping a wall in a turn.

Then there is just a TON of screen tearing, and long load times both starting a race, and trying to get out of one.  All this is on an Xbox One.

The graphics are about on par for the Infinity system, so sub par from any other racing kart game out there, but not too bad.  My son is far more forgiving than I am about the actual physics and behavior, and enjoys the tracks with familiar themes.  He is a big racing game fan, but this one he's not holding to the same standards as the others since it's characters and places he enjoys.  So he's less competitive here, and just enjoying the scenery more.  So I've added a star just based on that factor, since for me, it would've been a 2 star result, but because of his enjoyment of it anyway, I'll give it three.","Driving isn't much better than it is in the normal game, which means not very good",1444435200,9,,

While I have to hand it to Avalanche(makers of the the Tak games) for trying their hand at the DBZ license and trying to offer something new in this action adventure game; I'm quite disappointed in this Dragonball Z game. Sure, it does a good job at recreating the character models and environments from the show and even summoning up the storyline to the game(told in under a minute from old cartoon footage shown from the series ages ago) but it comes up lacking seriously in the feel and spirit of the series. Instead of adding some innovation and variety into its' gameplay(like Devil May Cry, God of War, or Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks), it comes across as an old and tired beat-em-up that's boring and repetitve.  You spend 99% of your time on the levels fighting saibamen and generic enemies before fighting characters you actually recognize from the DBZ universe. Then, you fight ridiculously long and challenging battles that seem completely unbalanced. Overall, It just isn't that fun or engaging to play.

Another thing I dislike about Dragonball Z Sagas is that the game is just too short and feels like it was rushed out too quickly for the masses.

So, yes you can begin the street art skill, science skill...etc. before even enrolling.

Your decisions effect your grades...skip a class and your grade slips, study hard and attend classes and you'll pass exams and your grades go up.  Your Sims can get multiple degrees and join multiple social circles.

First of all, this is one of the poorest software releases I have ever seen. Out of the box (er, download) it throws runtime errors. It doesn't work with Steamworks. And for reasons I don't understand, the much-vaunted soundtrack DOESN'T PLAY. Sure, Hotline Miami is an indy game, but lots of independent games... work.

Combat is also a little flat. Every attack by you or enemies is an instant kill, which means EVERY fight comes down to twitch-pounding the attack key at just the right time, a fraction of a second before the nearest enemy does so. Every fight is the same, and after a short time combat becomes so wearying and dull that following the compelling story isn't a worthwhile incentive to keep playing.

3.0,False,"03 3, 2013",A3PBT1IH3DWDSK,B00117GOWE,shureshot24,"I recently purchased this item to get started with a retro gaming collection, and for that its a great starting console. However there are some major issues with it. But lets start with the good first. First it has played pretty much every game I have thrown at it without too much issue, and seems to have a really high compatibility rate with Sega Genesis games. There have been a few NES games that have not worked but it plays the classics just fine so its not much of an issue. As for picture and sound quality, it gets the job done. The games don't look quite as crisp and the sound is a little off sometimes, but its barely noticeable. Like I said it gets the job done. Finally the console looks really cool and weighs almost nothing. Its also small as crap which is a big plus for me and my rather limited space.

Now its time for the bad aspects of this thing. First the Sega Genesis cartridge slot is too small or something. I seriously thought that it was the wrong size or it was built incorrectly and almost returned it. However in desperation I just shoved the game into the slot as hard as I could and well it does fit, but it grips the cartage so hard that you really have to yank on it just to pull it out. I was seriously worried that I was gonna break the thing just pulling out games, but the slot has loosened up a lot after using it a few times. So just use it like normal and it will loosen its grip after prolonged use. Thankfully the NES slot does not have that problem and NES games fit just fine and are easy to put in and pull out.

The second big issue is with the controller slots which are not original Sega Genesis slots. What does this mean, well it means you cant use original Sega Genesis controllers with this particular console which is kinda crappy. Also please don't be fooled by the look of the slots, original Sega Genesis controllers won't fit into them even though they seem to be the same, there not. I have tried to modify an original controller to fit into it but I simply cannot get them to work. This makes the final problem with this console a really big one which is.

THE CONTROLLERS SUCK! I mean there not terrible and they work fine as controllers, but the build quality is just crap. Within a month one of the control pads broke off at the base. How that happens I don't know, but I did it. Now I'm terrified to even use the second controller because as soon as that one breaks I'm gonna have to to shell out another 8 bucks to get another piece of crap replacement. Super glue seemed to work fine as a quick fix but I don't think its gonna hold forever. BTW if you bought this thing too and are looking for replacement controllers here is the link to the amazon page. http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B002UF8ZMS/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&condition=new

Overall I'm happy with my purchase but I'm pretty sure there are better consoles like this out there. Try to find one that does allow you to use original controllers on it because that has been a big issue for me or just spend the 35 bucks and get an original Sega Genesis. I wish someone on here mentioned that original controllers would not work on this console but now its here for everyone to know. If you just want something that will play both Sega Genesis and NES games this is fine but overall its better to just get an original Sega Genesis which will cost about the same.

The graphics are colorful and inventive, but no more so than you'd see in a regular Gamecube title. I like how the Wii remote is used sideways like a regular controller... that was cool. And the dialogue is so funny sometimes... but sadly, after a while it became the only real source of entertainment that I got out of the game. I'm a super-fast reader, so the amount of it didn't faze me... although I could have done without some of the more useless explanations and tidbits of information.

The one big thing that takes the cake for me in this game is: it's boring and tedious. It seriously takes out of the replay value for me, which is unfortunate, since I paid $50 for it straight up, at the store. The elevator music soundtrack and dragging gameplay is a good way to relax if you want to think about nothing important and just space out, though.

The Bad: Campaign is about as boring and short as WWII games can get, underwhelming graphics, enough with the WWII EA!

I played the PSP version several months ago (check out my review for that version) and I was really let down. The game was extremely tough even on the easier difficulties, and the campaign was short and boring. All those things are still in the Wii version but it's more forgivable thanks to the on-rails arcade mode thrown in, the great Wii controls, and the online multiplayer. While WWII games have been done to death this game is no exception.

EA struggled to piece together a stupid story that we've heard millions of times over and the campaign levels feel like games of the past and nothing like the newer games. After about 4-6 hours blowing through the campaign you can play the same levels in an arcade mode, which makes things easier, and go online.

3.0,False,"08 17, 2014",A2WXD0FN93ANT6,B00198PO5I,METRo,"I've never played the first game, but I saw how this game had such high reviews and I loved the story description, and GTA-style it seemed to have based on watching a few videos on YouTube. I had played L.A Noire and Red Dead Redemption, and the Uncharted series and I like this type of game, and i like games that are set in the past too.

The problem was that I was expecting a more open-area, longer play type of game.

Here are the Cons first:

This game really doesn't have a ""free roam""....that does anything. Sure you can go and buy clothes, buy coffee to up your health bar, smash cars in a junkyard, shoot/rob cashiers and get chased by cops, but it's not really exciting.

The missions themselves are fun, although I absolutely hate having to drive everywhere and not be able to just spawn to the next mission site from time to time....it gets REALLY boring to have to drive the speed-limit of 40mph (so you don't get cops chasing you or you could go faster when they're not around) and go across town, or have missions where you need to drive a friend somewhere. I get that they're trying to give you the feel of actually driving 40s-50s era cars and obeying laws...but that's not something i enjoy getting to live through as entertainment.

It's sad that the game didn't let you explore the world between missions more. I don't mean there needs to be side-missions or anything, but the people on the street don't care about you unless you punch them, the world seems barren and uneventful with nothing to really examine or jump or climb...i was hoping for something like Red Dead Redemption where you might find things here and there, interact with others...anything!

the cops magically spawn near you when you just so happen to be speeding sometimes, what a coincidence! And god forbid you just try to have some fun and explode a car or shoot some pedestrian....the cops don't show you any mercy and just keep spawning everywhere! Why punish the gamer for trying to make some interesting things happen?

Since there's nothing to do between missions except drive to the next mission, the game is really short. And I felt stiffed by the ending (Not going to spoil it) I finished in about 2 days, luckily I got it cheap, but even so, I felt a bit robbed!

And to end on the positive:

The story is really quite fantastic. It could have probably passed as a decent movie, and even the camera angles and cutscenes make it feel like a movie, which is cool, but also a bit limiting. They establish Vito as the main character very well, and I really liked him and felt for him and the mafia families were well established. Even though it's short, you will still be interested and immersed in the missions and entertained.

The graphics are nice. It's not going to have the facial recognition like L.A. Noire or even the dialogue/mouth lineup very well, but it doesn't really matter. Nice cars, great buildings and different mission settings that add variety.

They picked some good music for the radio and i found myself just driving along or taking the longer route to missions just to hear the whole song, and the music changed as the years go by, pretty nice.

Although I was bothered by the aiming for gun play, it still worked decently and wasn't too frustrating. It was nice to find a variety of weapons lying around that you could pick up from dead bodies to continue with.

The game has a similar setting and style to L.A. Noire so fans of the game will probably feel pretty comfy. However Mafia II is so short and doesn't let you explore. If I had known that ahead of time and was expecting a quick game for like a weekend treat, than I think I would have not been so disappointed.

It's an okay game, and now that I know it is what it is,  I would play it again..eventually.","Fun, but short and a tad disappointing",1408233600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

Basic Game Play:  3/5

Pets themselves seem to be fine, you are not able to control them, but you can see their needs. The stray walk-bys no longer leave puddles on your lot.  The Toddler/pet interaction is probably one of the best features in the game. The Sims Wants and Fears constantly revolving around their pets grows old quickly, as does their obsession with the pet itself.  The Commands that can be taught to the pet are also worth a few laughs.

Objects:  4/5

There are quite a few new objects in this game.  Obviously, most concern your pets.  However, I think they were a little skimpy on the pets' stuff.  I do like to Atomic Collection and the new kids room as well.

CAS: 1/5

No new hair, clothes, make-up, etc. They could have at least added some of the Pet Eye Genetics to the Sim Genetic list.  This is one of the biggest disapointments in the game.  The Pets aspect of CAS is pretty good.  You can customize just about every part of their body and layer each item for an even more customized look.  This is the lone factor that gets a star in this category.

Build:  5/5

The building objects in this game are the best so far.  The only drawback is the octoganal wall.  They can only be built as ix1x1x1x1x1x1x1 and cannot be drawn further.  The Walls, Floors, Fireplaces, etc are a much needed and welcome addition.  Also new, are floor lines, or room dividers.  These are simple lines drawn on the floor that allow a large room to be broken up.  This is usefull when using multiple walls in floors in a large area.

My overall opinion is that this is the lowest rated of the EP's, but is a welcome additon.  For those who liked Unleashed, you'll find this to be your favorite.  If you disliked Unleased, you won't be as fond of this games as the others, but it is still enjoyable.",A Minor Disapointment In An Otherwise Great Series,1162857600,11,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
3.0,True,"05 25, 2013",A2WNINTSFLXDDC,B005FYL82U,Kindle Customer,"I bought this game without ever playing any of the other versions. My understanding of it was simply, it is a more arcade like experience then the main WWE titles. You get a very limited roster of new and old stars, each falling into a set type. These are things like High Flyers, who use top rope and luch style moves. Or Giants, who are physically Strong but not to fast. You have a few others, but mostly just don't effect a whole lot. Strikers tend to have better attack options, but that is not to say other types can not slug it out effectively. The types tended to not matter to much in the end, but it was a neat idea.

The actual game-play is unique when compared to other WWE games. You can juggle people in the air, then grab them out of it with a slam. You can bounce people off a turnbuckle, and send them flying 20 feet up. All of your specials are just overly dramatic, and try to be very cinematic. The end result is a flashy looking game, that suffers by over simplifying things solely to look neat. You don't have tie ups because they do not fit with the style. You have a much smaller pool of moves then other games, and most of the superstars feel pretty much the same. You always see a finisher coming, since you have to enter a special stance or mode to use it. And some reversals, can not be reversed again, which just gets annoying when playing the gauntlet style mode.

The game has plenty of unlockables, but it won't keep you busy for long. There are multiple game modes, but thing like a career mode or universe mode. Overall it just feels like a very small offering. I paid 15$ for it, and I feel that price is about right. If you see it for any more then that, just pass on it.

Unfortunately, the game is a bit of a paradox.  It has so much going for it (the story, the soundtrack, the voice acting and writing, the cameos, and some of the gameplay) that the major faults of the game become ever more present in your mind the longer you play it.  You can feel the love of the developers have for ""metal culture,"" and that love remains apparent throughout.  The story was actually pretty good, and it hints at something running much deeper, although I doubt we will see a sequel in the next decade, if ever.  Even before I had gotten far into the story (2 or 3 missions) I was already questioning the decision to make Brutal Legend an open world game.  It was fun to drive around for a while, but the thrill of running over creatures and finding ""artifacts"" to unlock songs, stat increases, etc. wears off quickly.  Very quickly.  All of the ""side quest"" type activities are repetitive brawls, turret defense, hunting missions, and races.  These are largely mindless and leave you unsatisfied.

The game really loses steam and never recovers when you're introduced to your first stage battle.  These stage battles are boring, simple, and repetitive (there's that word again...).  I played on Brutal difficulty, and I only ""lost"" one, which I then restarted and won in about ten minutes.  I don't even see how hardcore RTS fans could enjoy these.  Every one is almost identical in terms of strategy and tactics, even when you're facing different ""factions.""  After sitting through a couple of these stage battles I would audibly groan when the scaffolding would start shooting up and the stage lights would come on.  I didn't bother trying the multiplayer (a rarity for me) as I had no desire to do stage battles online.

If you grew up watching Headbanger's Ball or are otherwise in love with metal, you should check the game out simply because it will really bring back some good memories.

Getting it running on Vista definitely took some moxie:  I would have saved hours if I had simply played through it ten years ago.

I had heard how original and fun the game was, but frankly it was a lot better before I actually sat down to play it, if you know what I mean.  Once you learn how to play, the campaign stages get quite repetitive and the game's ""sense of humor"" gets trying.  Additionally, I feel the gamemaker's attempt to shoehorn 3D into this game didn't add much and could have been completely dispensed with:  at least it should have been optional.

2.  This was meant to run on ""Windows 95 / 98 / Me,"" according to the packaging.  I've also never had a problem running it on XP.  It is possible to get it fully running on Vista or 7 and I am here to tell you it can be done.  Try some combination of these, starting with f, then d.

a.  Right click and run program as administrator.
b.  On the compatibility tab, set it to run in Windows 2000; disable visual themes, disable desktop composition, and
 disable display scaling on high DPI settings.
c.  Although DKII puts a shortcut on your desktop, I found have it not to work with Vista or 7:  you must go into the original Bullfrog folder and launch the game directly from the executable, keeping in mind a and b above.
d.  Right click on your desktop.  Under display settings, disable hardware acceleration.  If you can't do this sweepingly (e.g., because you have an NVIDIA, go to the NVIDIA control panel for DKII and disable virtually everything, especially texture filtering.
e.  Bear in mind that DKII not only runs its own executable, but it runs another program simultaneously which is actually the game engine.  The process shows as ip.exe.  So anything you do to the DKII.exe should also be done to that.
f.  Run DKII.  Go into the graphics options, uncheck all those boxes:  visual translucency, environment mapping, and especially the last:  hardware acceleration. Set shadow detail to 0.  What you do with gamma is irrelevant.
g.  You can get quite discouraged if you're going through all this and you keep getting those black squares on the menu screens.  But if you go into the graphics options and keep finding that, upon being restarted, the game has rechecked ""hardware acceleration"" without your permission, do not be angry.  Simply accept.  Go back into the main menu and load an actual pet dungeon or a campaign dungeon.  When DKII reloads one of those, that check should go away and stay away even after you close the game.  In other words, when you uncheck ""hardware acceleration,"" the game must actually load a dungeon for this to take effect.  If you simply uncheck it and exit the game, it won't take.
In addition, I have posted a link to a Youtube video in the comments that I found helpful in this struggle.
h.  It is not my experience that setting graphics options to low or running the game in 640x480 is going to help you at all when trying to get it to run under Windows Vista and Windows 7.
i.  It shouldn't matter whether you applied the patch or not:  I have gotten it to run both ways on Windows Vista and Windows 7, although only with the final 1.7 patch:  I don't know about the three or four patches that came before that, all of which are still available on the internet as of this writing.
j.  If all else fails, be aware that it might be your sound card that's causing a problem, not your video card.  This game seems to like simple sound cards and has a reputation for not working on account of the newer, snazzier ones.  If all else fails, try disabling your spiffy sound card in the Device Manager to see if the onboard sound on your mother board will give this a pass.

By the way, I want the world to know that it took me longer to figure out how to play this under Windows Vista and Windows 7 than I actually spent playing the game!

Let me start by saying that the mouse can be comfortable, but you must spend some time with it, get the feel of it and adjust it as you go, I got medium size hands, and at the beginning I had some cramps from holding it, but was able to finally adjust it to my most comfortable setting. The best adjustment feature for me is the pinkie rest; nothing like having your whole hand slide smoothly along with the mouse. The software, unlike some have stated, is not hard to use, I got MOH and BFBC2 to work flawlesly, the key is to use the included guides in the program about settings, programming, etc. The DPI settings are great, but I don't think anybody actually uses the max settings, it's just too fast. Switching from DPI to DPI is done on the fly, easily and without a hitch. The one button I had to getting used to was the ""mode"" button, but after adjusting the overall hardware, I was able to get it to my liking. Battery swaping is done easily as well, of course, you do lose power when switching batteries, but that can not be avoided, it is fast though, in and out.

Before I go on, I'm sure you all know by now, that the thumb rest of the mouse can be adjusted both sideways and front to back.

Now, the reason I had to return it, and believe me, as I'm writting this, I am deeply dissapointed, because I waited a long time for this mouse to be shipped and had high hopes and a lot excitment about it, but as I was testing the mouse while playing MOH, the sideways setting for the ADJUSTABLE THUMB REST became loose as I pressed the precision button; at first I thought I hadn't tighten it properly, so I went ahead and checked it, but to my surprise, the adjustment was already very tight, I could not go any further with it. Anyway, my heart dropped, and I let go of a very loud AWWWW!!!! I couldn't believe it! I tried loosen it up, and tighting it back up, but it was no use.

IMO, durability of the mouse will be an issue, because of that sideway adjustment of the thumb rest. For the 100 price tag, I can't afford to even try to convince myself that the adjustment won't get any worse, because it will. I hope MadCatz takes note of this, I really think that the sideway adjustment for the thumb rest would've been better if it was done the way the palm rest is, with a locking mechanism and not a screwing one, like it is now.

Anyway, that's it for me and the Rat 9, but if the mouse does work for you, great, I'm really glad. But it didn't for me. I simply can't afford it. I went through a rough time with my Razer Mamba, it gradually and literaly stopped working and fell apart. I can't have that happen again.

I hope this review helps you decide whether this mouse is for you, or worth your hard earned money. Peace.",Loved it....But I had to return it. Read on...,1291075200,2,,

- The sceneries of all the different places around the world.
- Story. Which is a continuation to to ""Legends"".
- Being a Tomb Raider game with all its puzzles.

Didnt like:
- Glitchy graphics and bad animation. It makes you feel like its gonna stall.
- It was somewhat short and there were no boss fights!
- The ending was sudden and did not match the built hipe.
- Not much of a challange. Almost didn't die once and only used Meds twice or three times throughout.

As Rayne, you fight your way from the bayous to Argentina, in a wild hunt to keep ex-Supreme Commander Jurgen Wulf from reassembling Beliar, a demon even older than Satan himself.  If you are thinking running around killing everything that moves, you have pretty well pinpointed the key features of this game.
Rayne has all the requisite weapons and attacks, the artwork is good, and the action is unending.  Unfortunately, the game starts out awkwardly and then settles into a predicatble and somewhat tedious pattern.  Your first real hint that this game has a real problem is when you hit the first major boss after the initial mission.  It's not that you don't have the stuff to kill him, it's that killing him requires a set of motions that are almost impossible to do, and it requires them repeatedly.
This leaves the player with two choices - get killed until you are ready to scream, or cheat.  Nor does cheating work wonders, it just reduces the pain.  This happens several other times in the progress of the game.  There is a lot to play, but much of the play is more frustrating than fun.  At first, I thought the problem was my middle-aged reflexes, but I've note the same issue being brought up elsewhere.  And this isn't the type of game where there is a payoff for all the controllers thrown against the wall.
You will have to decide for yourself.  There is nothing particularily unique about this game, but there certainly is lots of violence and gore for entertainment.  But I believe there are too many more interesting shooters to invest hours in this one.  The good news is that the price keeps dropping and there are lots of cheat codes.

3.0,False,"03 1, 2008",A14ET1IZB8N855,B000VM0NKY,Darren Sisco,"I'm a big Lost fan so I carefully waited for the game to be available at the local Blockbuster and sure enough I was the first renting it.

First Impressions:  The title screen is lovely and it led to an anticipation of whats to come.  Turning it on however, I was greeted by blocky controls.  At first I thought I had freedom to move about the island but turned out I was wrong, everything is set on paths.  Your character kind of quirks and jerks around the island stumbling into unmoveable bushs with all his stiffness.  Follow this up with 'what just happened' cut scenes and dabble on a self-centering bad camera angle and you have your opener of sorts.  Jungles have never been accurately reproduced in games, I was hoping this would be an exception.

Play it Again Sammy:  The game blocks it up like episodes of the show, think Matrix: the Game, only with intros and logos.  I didn't like the 'previously on Lost' intro showing me what I played just seconds earlier but this works well when you go back to earlier episodes or pick it back up after taking a break.  They could have canned the intro while you were playing and it would have been an improvement.  Adding the Lost Logo at the mystery point near the beginning and the mystery at closing was a very nice touch but in some instances, out of place.  While your running around you pick up loose items and put them in your backpack.  You trade these for items you need, torches, oil, handguns.  Collect everything you find and you won't have any issues with currency.  Eventually this feels like your only collecting fuses and beer.  You become the red neck Thomas Edison of the island with a backpack full of brewskies and the knowledge of electricity.

Getting Lost in It:  There I am on the beach, this story doesn't follow between 2 and 3, it starts at the beginning.  The wreckage scene was not accurately shown, bummer.  Tech heads would point out the left wing was gone all together and the still running engine was originally mounted next to the fusalage not out in the open say between the blown engine and the fusalage.  Here is where the game play gets really odd.  Your first mission is to divert the fuel flow to prevent an explosion.  How?  Your best guess and stumbling around looking for something that glimmers that you can click on.  Oh, its one of those games!  You simply walk around and look for something to get shiny.  Hmmm.  From there on out its being an errand boy.  Find your luggage.  Another walk around, this time with dummy objects to slow your progress.

Let The Exploration Begin:  ""Find your camera""...okay now you get to journey off the beach and thank the light, not a moment too soon.  Here is where you find another idea they came up with for you to do.  Its 'find your waypoints' time in the jungle.  Find your waypoint and it will point you to the next waypoint 30 feet away.  Some waypoints are hidden, others can be skipped.  All together its a romp in the park.  Then you find the front nose of the plane.  Again, not accurate at all with the film, they put it hanging over a cliff.  Why?  On board the plane is another puzzle to divert power to the electronically locked compartment.  Sayid would be proud.  Even after solving the puzzle you can 'steal' the fuses for later use, brillant.

Do The Hokey, Pokey:  This is pretty much the giest of the game.  Get your mission,  get through the ever increasing difficulty of the jungle (way points turn into compass points you have to cross reference, the jungle has Ben's guys shooting at you and finally you have to make your way past a fast pathing Black Smoke...while walking...with Black Rock Dynomite), find your target and return, Rinse Repeat.

Mini Games?  There is two instances of a 'run for your life' part thats interesting even with the blockly controls and bad camera angle.  The two cave journey parts are interesting as long as you think ahead...Think fumbling around in Shadowgate back in the day with no torches.  There is a Swan Station part that was very interesting with you playing with the computer doing things that Locke couldn't find that lends itself to an all inclusive venture of the station and here they really shined with accuracy, my hats off for this part and the equally thrilling Flame Station part.

ShutterBug:  There is parts in the game where your clued in on taking a picture.  Somethings are hidden and you must find the special path to find these things but there is usually some risk involved.  Getting the snapshot is more thrilling then the Game concept art the game rewards you with back at the main menu.  However, getting the right shot can be obnoxiously hard at times.  I took a picture of a laptop a dozen times from different angles before it accepted the 'win'.  Even my wife mentioned something was off with that.  They could have really done better with the camera's rewards or even had hidden things for taking scenic shots ala Metal Gear Solid.  Still a lot of the hidden item shots is cheeky fun to do.

New stuff!  I'm not going to divulge into any of the new things that your adventure on the island will uncover.  Up to now its been stuff we all know.  There is one instance at the Flame where you go 'oh thats why that happened'.  You also eventually get to see more of the Hydra and the Black Rock, no big deal but fun nonetheless.  There is finally a 'gap filler' that is presented.  This is a nice albiet short lived portion that had me screaming for my wife to check out.  Its a wonderful present in the middle of it all making the rental much worth the money.  Another piece of the puzzle and something I can finally breathe a sigh of relief on.  You'll have to rent it to find out for yourself.  Snicker!

Mi Capitane!  The main characters presented for you to talk to in your flight.  The talking sessions remind me of the blocky Knights of the Old Republic chat scenes, however, your questions have little bearing of consequences.  Ask away!  The voice acting is superb and most of the characters are believeable, some sound like they have a cold.  All together it had my wife fooled into thinking they were the real deal.  Mums the word!  The character models are excellent but thier motions are very robotic.  Its thier hands, they don't move thier hands.  Thier face is expressionable and extremely close to the actor they portray but they end up looking like a talking head on a manniquine.

The Hills are Alive!  The visuals, even with the exception of inaccuracies of special locales are stunningly beautiful.  They put a lot of heart into how it looked.  Even the jungle with its waypoint gimmick is something to behold.  Sometimes I want to just look at what they done and all the hard work they put into it but they don't lend themselves to giving you said time because of dangers.  Its not 'the' island, it 'an' island.  The layout for the most part is great and leads itself to adventuring.  Hi-res rocks the world!

It All Comes Out in the Wash:  I wrapped this rental up in 8 hours.  It has very little replay value which is a loss in my mind from all the work they put into it.  I would only go back to find the picture opportunities I missed and the few hidden locations I know are still out there.  Lost: Via Domus did not leave a bad taste in my mouth but its shortness was dissappointing.

On defense, your computer controlled teammates leave people wide open and don't get back on defense and can't rebound.  The CPU scores way too easily when inside the paint with these dinky little back door layups and their 3 pt shooting percentage is totally unrealistic.  Offensively, the gameplay is adequate, but again, your players cannot rebound.  The opposing team will rebound over your head with no foul call all the time. I know this is more of a simulation basketball game and you have to play defense or the CPU will make you pay, but there's too many bugs offensively and defensively and very questionable AI.

- Campaign is fun.  It's setup similar to Mass Effect or Splinter Cell Blacklist in that you have a base/ship to upgrade gear inbetween missions, which is a nice addition to a CoD campaign.  Also, the addition of space combat/flight simulation in this game are great!  I wish games like Elite Dangerous made flying like this.  Well done.
- Zombies is good.  Lots to do.
- Multiplayer is hit and miss.  The exo suits are customizable with different abilities.  Guns are pretty cool.  Supply drops are good.  Overall just a much more developed class creation system.  Similar to DOOM on the game ending podium, the top 3 players of the match can do different poses/salutes, just cosmetic but fun.

Cons
- You'll need 51+ Gb of storage space on your xbox or usb hdd to install/play the game.
- The miss on the multiplayer is that its pretty fast paced with the futuristic additions, makes it feel more akin to halo or DOOM than CoD was traditionally.
- MW remastered isn't a stand alone purchase...yet

I don't understand why this game is getting ripped so badly.  However my experience with this game was as a gamefly rental, so I don't have the ""I bought this"" feeling weighing me down.  I can also say after returning it to gamefly, I don't miss it.  A lot of the negative reviews I see though aren't really based off IW per se, many bash it for not having MW Remastered separate and others bash it for their opinion of what CoD should be.  Really its up to you, try the game for yourself if you enjoy CoD in general.  Every CoD game is pretty well put together, this one is better than most.  There's a lot to like and a lot to dislike depending on your opinion but this is by no means a bad game.  There are many games worse than this.  If you take the game as it is, no comparisons, its a solid and good game.

I waited for a price drop. I can honestly say after having played on and off for a little over a week, even with the price drop this game is certainly not worth anywhere past 40$. I could write a whole page review concerning this game but many of the things that I would say have been said by other reviewers. Also even with all the reviews I'd gone through and looking at the let's play videos, I still purchased this game; I have been a simmer since TS1 so with the price drop I decided to give this game a try. Not everything in TS4 is awful; their new build mode and the rich vibrant (even though the environmental background might be simulated) neighborhood is welcoming and fresh. I'm not too keen on the loading screens in fact I'm curious to see how that will pan out once expansion packs start its' release. The toddler stage has been completely omitted so the infant ""popping"" out to a full grown child is honestly ridiculous and hilarious. I also don't dislike or like the pre-color coded options. It works and it doesn't work, meaning some of the design/color options are just terrible and unable to match. I also began to see a growing number of bugs here and there I'm not certain if it was because I kept the game turned on for awhile or because the Sims game as we all know it has an increasing amount of bugs in the first place. I understand that alot of the things that were omitted were to have the game run smoother and it does but it has a design flaw. The game grows on you and it's fun however how long will that last for its' asking price or until the first expansion pack is released? All in all for those of you out there who are on the fence about buying this game like many others have said, buy it for the right price. This base pack certainly lacks content for its' asking price but that is also nothing new with the Sims game franchise, unfortunately. (i.e ts3 eps)

3.0,True,"01 8, 2010",A1YASLALDPHHJ7,B001HWB68K,Shaun L. Stoffer,"The campaign consisted of around eight levels that were all together around ten hours of acutal gameplay depending on what difficulty level you choose to play, for me, I always start out with normal for my first playthrough then work my way up to legendary. I played co-op whenever I had one of my friends over, who's a Halo fanatic, and we cleared the first five levels on heroic in about 2.5-3 hours.

You play from the perspectives of a group of soldiers and switch between them at the start of each mission. One mission in particular I found suprisingly boring and annoying, in it you must scavenge around different parts of a ruined city to find beacons that explain what happened there. This mission has eight parts and you must complete one at a time after you finish the actual missions. It felt like I was playing Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider, minus all the jumping and climbing, in the sense that the majority of the level was looking mindless roaming. Because of this, I didn't get to experience fighting a group of enemies every step of the way which is what I craved from the Halo series.

Being able to dual wield was eliminated from the campaign for some odd reason, but you gained the ability to switch to basically a form of night vision at the touch of a button. With it, you can see and distinguish enemies, allies, and objectives fairly easier at night. Far from a fair trade, but better than nothing.

Another thing I found frustrating was that if you finish half the game in co-op, you cannot continue the other half solo. Instead, you have to start over from mission one. Pointless.

The music, graphics, even the story is all much darker than all the other previous Halo games. That's not to say that the sinister appeal was negative, but just not what you would expect from Halo.

Getting all the map packs for Halo 3 on the second disk was nice to a certain extent. However, you don't actually get the downloads to save to your hard drive, the multiplayer is all on the second disc and you cannot store any of the map packs - which made me less than estatic. So if you were thinking about playing through the campaign once or twice, saving the map packs to your drive, and trading ODST in for $30 and just using your Halo 3 disc for the multiplayer - it ain't happening, sorry. This was, by far, my biggest issue with ODST.

Therefore, if you paid $60 for ODST, you got ripped off. I paid $30 and would say that is a fair price but not worth a cent more.",Halo ODST: Not what I was hoping for,1262908800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

RE6 is basically three games in one. There are four campaigns, with the fourth unlocked only after completing the first three. Each campaign is told through a different protagonist, each plays differently from the other, and each have their own AI companion. First, there is Leon Kennedy's campaign, which is the closest campaign to earlier RE games. Second, there is Chris Redfield's campaign, which essentially feels like a generic 3rd person shooter. Third, there is Jake Muller's campaign, is something of a combination of the two. Finally, the Ada Wong campaign, is allegedly a stealth style campaign. Overall, I felt that the Jake Muller campaign was the most fun, if only for the missions in Chinatown. As for the worst, that would be Chris Redfield's campaign, which also has the worst of the endlessly repetitive boss battles. Seriously, we don't need each boss to ""die,"" come back, ""die,"" and then finally killed with a quicktime.

The other problem that plagues the game are the the awkward camera & cover system. The camera is just too close to the characters, while the cover system often forces characters to snap against walls automatically whenever a firearm is drawn, regardless of the player's desire. Firing from cover isn't fun, since the camera once is unable to provide an adequate angle or distance to ensure accurate aiming.

In terms of improvements, I enjoyed that the characters can now move while they shoot. Also, the game has a pretty good AI system. However, this game just has too many damn quick-time events, and the boss battles go on forever!

The Motion Plus adds onto an existing Wii remote. With an add on accessory like this, the only good thing to say is that it works. As the descriptions and other reviewers have already said, this accessory works as intended.

There is one obvious drawback though. If you use Motion Plus for older games or games not formatted for Motion Plus then you'll experience a problem. The Motion Plus can and will activate controls unintentionally which can be annoying, but can also cause you to die (in game). Here are a few examples: in Metroid Prime (Trilogy edition) Samus will transform into a ball by swinging the Wii remote and this can happen just by moving the remote to scroll across the screen. Its very annoying and caused me to lose some boss battles. In Dead Space: Extraction, it caused my weapons to switch by moving the remote across the screen.

So seeing this release was really welcome news to me. Even more since I could play it on my PSP. But after it finally arrived, and I popped it in my PSP, I was a bit upset. Reasons are as follows:

-Load times are terrible and there are many of them

This you can overlook slightly because it is no where near as bad as Shodown III on the original Playstation. But it does get to the point you'd rather keep the game loaded even while the console is off so you don't have to sit through it all again.

-Audio lags, really bad. Even in the older games.

This problem is worse in the later games. Especially SSVI. I've never seen a game ported so bad where the audio lags behind the action by at least a few seconds in some cases. Really how did this even escape testing? Its not as pronounced in the first three games but even in those, its there. The game is playable despite this but it is distracting

-Animation lags, mostly SSVI

This is mostly an issue with SSVI. But at times, usually at the start of a fight, the action will freeze for a moment as like the system isn't finished loading yet.

-SSVI is without a doubt, the worst of the entire series

Ok being a fan for years, i've seen the games get better graphically but SSVI is literally almost like playing a cellphone game. The backgrounds are poor quality and the animations are stiff and rigid in comparison to the prequels before it. Visually, it is also graphically inferior to SSIII-SSV. Then getting to the controls, its just as bad. Characters just do not move as well as they did in previous games. I'm not sure if its a porting issue or what but literally its like they made SS for cellphones then slapped a fanservice maid on the cover as a new character and called it SSVI.

-Finally, and not really something i'm proud to admit, the endboss of SSVI is probably the most overpowered and unbalanced boss i've ever seen.

I'm used to SS final bosses being tricky at times but SSVI's endboss is horrors. He has an extremely long range weapon that can hit you even across the screen and practically decimate your health in only a few shots. Then to make it worse, he's buffed with so many special moves and attacks that with some characters its near impossible to land a hit. But thats not the worst part. He does a special powerup move frequently and if you get caught in it, your weapon is shattered and he pretty much instant win. He tends to use it most when your in the air and can't defend so characters with strong aerial attacks are useless. After a few hours total trying different fighters, I finally used Gen-an and beat him but its just insane how poorly designed he is. And yes, I did finally drop the difficulty to lvl 1. You don't want to know how much worse he is on normal lvl 4 and I don't want to ever see higher than that.

So now that all that is out of the way, why do I give it a 3/5 instead of worse?

Simple. There are five great games here which are great to play on the PSP. Putting the issues aside, all of them look great on this handheld. In fact, some even look better than I remember. Just loading up SSII took me back to those good ole days wasting money in the arcades playing it.

Really if you play the classics and avoid SSVI, this is a great title for the PSP. Sure you don't have the arcade stick to go with it, but controls are very nice and work well on the little PSP. I'd just recommend using D-pad as the stick is sloppy when trying to do the combos or specials.

For fans of this series, buy it, enjoy it, never play SSVI. You can't get much better for a handheld with five great Samurai Shodown games. Putting up with it's quirks is just a small price to pay for that.","Sloppy port, but great classics",1253145600,2,{'Platform:': ' Sony PSP'},

Showing your character running around the screen and interacting with the environment, you can see the bad guys running up and taking damage. 3 zoom levels are available but I never used anything but the most zoomed-out, otherwise your running around blind.

The game starts off with several different character types, each one is fairly generic (Dark Elf, Vampire, Gladiator, etc.) but what makes them interesting is that each is given a unique fighting style. I selected a character that has spells as well as fighting abilities.. it made it fun as the left mouse whacked the monsters with my sword and the right mouse button cast a spell at them. I found that I used the wind spell and the ring-of-fire spell. The ring-of-fire is cool because you can stand unharmed in a ring and the monsters have to walk into the fire to get you..the fire usually does twice as much damage as I do!

The world is HUGE! its amazingly detailed - the artists deserve massive kudos for what they put into the game, there is a simply amazing amount of detail, from the mushrooms growing bewtween cracks to half overgrown altars in the woods to the very trees themselves..just astonishing. And the dungeons look fantastic as well.

The main quest is intertesting, although its a standard ""kill the big monster"" plot line, there was enough detail, especially as you discover what is going on, to make it fun. The side quests are a welcome system ,you can do them or not - its your choice. They are almost all the typical ""kill the monster over there"" or ""rescue my sister/wife/maiden/etc"" or ""escort me to x"".. but you can accept or not as you choose.

What Sacred gets right:

The spells are interesting and their effects are great. The spell concept of auto-recharge is a welcome change from the tired ""mana-battery"" style of play where you have to keep drinking ""mana potions"". In Sacred all spells have a ""recharge"" interval and after so many seconds you can cast the spell again.. simple as that. The more complex or potent the spell the longer it takes to recharge. It works great and makes battles fun as you select repeatable spells.

The world and quest are fun and interesting.

The objects/weapons/armor you find are interesting, especially the ability to insert things into objects - makes it fun to try new things

What Sacred didn't do so right:

The ""combo"" system.. its supposed to be some kind of thing where you can combine different attacks to do something but it never worked right for me. The combos were so weak and the recharge period so slow that the spells worked 10 times better.

The horses.. supposedly riding the horse is one of the big things in the game, I never found them to be anything but a pain. They die all the time, you can't do much of anything while on horseback, they are only marginally faster than running and when doing rapid clicking in the midst of a battle you tend to automatically dismount and run around off the horse anyway.. after the first few died, I just ignored them after that.

The objects.. supposedly like Diablo there are tons of cool objects with different powers, but I found ""Dagowits"" objects fairly early in the game and never found anything better. The stores don't sell anything, even healing potions. I quickly had hundreds of thousands of $$ without anything to spend it on.

The spell levels.. I think its goofy to have a level 43 character and still be using level 3 spells. You only get the spell levels randomly and they arrive far too slowly. By the end of the game the spell I used the most was still only at level 3! Its massively frustrating to clean out an entire dungeon and get to the chest at the end of it, open the chest and have 642 pieces of gold pop out when you already have 300,000

The ending.. I won't give it away but I really expected a lot more.. bigger I guess, there is a big boss monster, but I think I had a glitch because it appeared right on top of me and I never took a hit from it. I just expected things to get bigger and tougher, with rooms filled with new monsters or something.. you start chapter IV and then there is only one room and the game is over.. wierd.

Overall however, I liked the game. It was fun to play, the world is a kick to run around in and explore. I spent a lot of time going to places I didn't need to go to, like paths through the woods just to see what was there.. its amazing how much detail is around. I did most of the quests, just to talk to people and see what was around.

My opinion: I found this game particularly short and, aside from the final battle, not very challenging (my boy-friend and I finished it over the weekend).

As a big AC fan, I expected a lot from this game--perhaps too much.  Overall, I liked the game, and really like Connor (I know most people don't), but there are serious issues in this game that make it less than an ideal experience.

STORY
Most parts of the story were hit or miss.  In this game, Desmond takes control of his ancestor Connor Kenway, a half Native American assassin who experiences the Revolutionary War.  Though...if you play this game, you'd hardly know there was a war.  For most of the game I felt like Connor was just being flung into random scenarios.  I was especially shocked to see how little you are involved with the actual founding fathers.  You only meet with George Washington a couple of times (despite what the advertisements want to make you believe); one reviewer mentions you meet Thomas Jefferson, which frankly mystifies me, because I don't recall a single instance where you meet him, which sucks because I really like Jefferson.  The Desmond sequences were fun to play for once, though--I won't spoil anything, but the missions do involve you more and have you doing more than just running through places.  The ending sequence was just a disaster, though.

Frankly, the only part of the story I found interesting was during the Haytham + Connor sequences.  Haytham is a very likeable character, and I enjoyed all of his sequences.  Charles Lee is a good baddie, although he veers off into ""simply evil just to be evil"" territory.  I didn't like Connor until I played the Homestead sequences; otherwise he comes off as very two-dimensional, and in some instances, a selfish arse (like his argument with Achilles).  People shouldn't have to play optional side quests to see that a game's main character isn't two dimensional though.  I do like Connor though, he's especially fun to fight with :)

To sum this up--Ubisoft, instead of focusing on revolutionizing the climbing and fighting system, you should have invested more time in the story.  As a revolutionary war phile, the story was a bit of a letdown.

GAMEPLAY
Some people have complained that the gameplay is worse now, but I disagree; I think everything, especially the fighting system, has improved.  Being able to climb more than buildings is refreshing, and being able to explore the frontier and see the interaction between wildlife and everything else is very, very lovely.  The world truly does feel open and with so much to explore, it certainly made up for the disappointing storyline.

Re: Combat style; This took me a little while to master, but once you do, it's very fun.  Combat is much faster now and you can do counters even faster.  You can also different weapons to do different kills; I am especially fond of the rope dart.

What I loved the most, however, were the naval battles.  I didn't expect to like this, in fact, it was one of the things I wasn't looking forward to!  But it is so fun to play, somewhat simple, but does take some skill to learn.  I really hope Ubisoft releases a DLC with more naval battles, because I really want to play some more.

There is A LOT to do in this game aside from the main storyline, which I love.  They say this is a 40+ hour game but I've played over 60 hours (at 99% synch).

GRAPHICS
Nothing much has changed from previous AC games, though that's been the case with every AC game.  I do love the little details in the game, though, like pigs walking in the street, seeing people buy food at the market, and even how the wildlife interacts in the wilderness (like seeing two elk fight).  There are some graphical glitches, but the recent patch fixed most of them.  What it did not fix were the graphics in the underground, which flash and look uncompleted, it looks really weird.  Also, in some scenes if you're wearing a different costume, it sometimes looks like Connor has a buzzcut, which he doesn't.

GLITCHES
I had to make a separate section for this because I am utterly amazed by the amount of glitches in this game.  I'm just amazed!  Some quests were just unfinishable (like the Oak Island quest, I had to restart multiple times because the puzzle section just did not work); one time I actually got trapped under some rocks and had to fast travel to New York to escape lol.  A couple of times my game crashed during some naval battle sequences, which infuriated me. I cannot list all of the glitches I ran into while playing because there are too many to list, but I'm really disappointed.  I've never played a game with these many glitches before, and it makes me wonder if Ubisoft even had beta testers.

Overall, this game did not live up to its expectations.  While I did love certain aspects of the gameplay, the convulted storyline, poor character development, and a silo of glitches made me dislike it immensely.  Out of all AC games, I'd put this second to last, the last being Revelations of course.  I'd put AC1 above it, followed by AC:B in 2nd and AC2 in 1st.",Glitches ruin the playing experience,1354233600,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"01 15, 2015",A3SF4HPCLFC2GI,B00B59L9YG,Mannjon,"For many years now, Resident Evil has continued to evolve the survival horror genre of gaming. As a new Wii U owner, I decided to try out Revelations for myself having no prior expectations aside from having recently replayed RE4 and RE5. What I found was a mixture of good and bad elements.

Gameplay: 3/5
This may actually be personal preference, but for me personally, I think Revelations dropped the ball here. Traditionally in the series, the idea was that you are stuck on some remote location either marooned or sent in as a special OPs team member to investigate an outbreak. While the story may follow this trend in spirit, the gameplay is divided into chapters that seem out of place. The action is broke up into chapters instead of being one long event. This for me ruins what was paramount in the other games. This non-continuous style not only breaks up the action, but it also tends to take away the whole survival horror aspect. You also have someone with you on most of the missions that is neither playable nor helpful. This further takes away form the sense of survival horror. While it isn't a bad direction to take the series in general, I think it was poorly executed at best. It isn't so much of a survival horror as it is a mission based 3rd person action game. On a plus, the use of a map feature on the gamepad is brilliant. I hated having to bring up the menu to check my map in the previous games, having it shown all the time on the gamepad is a wonderful addition. There is no 2 player co-op either, which is not that important to me personally, but would have been nice to have.

Graphics: 4/5
The graphics are better than the system it was ported from, but nothing above and beyond. On the whole there are some minor things that improve things such as better water effects, much more attention to ambient lighting, and better texture mapping. While this is nothing special, it is a slight upgrade about on par with RE5 on the PS3. The level designs have a lot of good detail and when you are actually playing, the level design is immersive enough to captivate you to take in the scenery for what it is.

Sound: 5/5
Aside from the meaningless story telling, sound effects and music are quality as usual. I had no problems here.

Controls: 1/5
This is perhaps the only unforgivable part of this game. The controls are stiff, and you can't use the Nunchuck/Remote. Aiming is hard to do with precision, and has a very steep learning curve. You can at least adjust the aim speed, but you can't actually adjust the stick sensitivity. I am the type of player that can make every shot a headshot or critical shot, but the Wii U gamepad sticks are very low to react and require a lot of force to manipulate which results in decreased accuracy. On top of that, the dodge system is completely broken. For a controller that has so many buttons, you'd think there would be a dedicated doge button. This isn't the case. Dodging is a crucial element to the RE series, and with Revelations, you are better to just run past or shoot from afar because dodging requires you to run forward through an attack or back away with a really awkward timing system. It takes a long time to get used to and isn't as effective as just running right past a threat.

Story: 2/5
It kind of fills in the gap between RE4 and RE5... but... it doesn't do a great job at it either. The voice acting is something to be desired and the cut scenes don't really add that much to the story line. I won't divulge too much information in the sense of being spoiler free other than to say that I was a little disappointed with the story and the way it was told.

As a fan of the series, I've owned/beat/played/still own a lot of the games in the series. I remember first playing RE1 on the PC of all things. I remember being absolutely terrified of what was to come, and there was always a sense of fight or flight. But with Revelations, I didn't get that sense at all. There aren't as many ""gotcha"" moments when a BOW reaches out of nowhere and scares the crap out of you. It just doesn't have that feel. I also loved RE4 in the sense that it maintained a lot of the original feeling from the first games while having a fresh gameplay system and story line.

All in all, this isn't a bad game. The problem is, that for the same price (or less) you can get RE4 for the Wii which is a MUCH better game. It just didn't live up to my expectations for what I know could have been a much better executed game.",A Generic Attraction from a Name Brand Series,1421280000,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I've also spent a fair amount of time racing F2000 cars as well as karting.  I've been looking for a new way to get seat time from the comfort of my own home, so to speak, since most of the console racers keep getting somewhat tailored for the casual players and less for those with more experience, and also perhaps to exchange one set of problems for another since some of the enduring problems with the console racers can make one get a bit fed up.  Well exchange one set of problems for another I certainly did.

rFactor is amazing when it comes to all the mods that are available.  It's truly dizzying how many different eras of cars, tracks, and other changes to the game are available, and the quality in some cases is very impressive.  However that is both its greatest strength and it can be its biggest hassle.  The game just isn't very good right out of the box - particularly with the driving physics and force feedback, it's very difficult to sense what the car is doing so driving even at a ""swift"" pace let alone ""on the limit"" is rather difficult.  This is part of the dilemma of when sims get ""too realistic"": ultimately you'll always be limited to sitting in a motionless chair looking at a 2D screen in front of you (unless you can invest tens of thousands of dollars on a sweet full motion 3D rig), so you're already at a disadvantage when it comes to true depth perception and feeling the weight of the car at all four corners and being able to react in time with it to turn a fast lap.  If the FFB sucks, the whole ballet of inputs to make the car trace the racing line at high speed falls apart.

So you spend a lot of time tweaking, adjusting, testing, readjusting, installing new mods, trying again, getting fed up, installing more mods... for days and days yet ultimately still more or less having the same problems despite all the time and effort spent improving the experience.  The problem is, I had expected it to be way better than the racing games I had already played on the consoles - which would make it worth all the extra time spent tinkering.  But it's not.  The graphics are nowhere near today's standards, and physics-wise it's hardly even playable - I play all my games with all the driver aids turned off and have never had such difficulty just keeping the car on track, let alone actually putting together a decent lap.  There just isn't a ""tame"" mode in rFactor where you can drive at 90% and feel planted.  The car simply won't turn if you try that.

Mullins,"This is the game that has been promised to those who have spent hours each day dreaming about how awesome it would be to be a truly powerful Jedi. It was supposed to allow you to experience the role of an utterly powerful Jedi/Sith like no other game. And it does, sort of. Overall the game does a pretty good job of maintaining the illusion of being a super powered bad dude. But its the minor imperfections, and there are a lot, that drag it back down towards mediocrity.

As an adventuring game with a large amount of platforming the camera gives me a large amount of trouble. There are situations where it will fix in place and make maneuvering very difficult. It will also occasionally cause you to miss landings and fall to your death. There are also a large amount of spaces that you would think you are able to maneuver your character to, only to learn they aren't part of the stage as you fall to your death. Without good camera control you aren't able to ever get a good look at these areas before you commit.

The combat can be fun, but suffers from very poor targeting. There are so many times you try to scoop up an enemy only to have your target change. So you lift a rock as a droid pummels you. And for being a guy with a light saber there are a huge amount of enemies equipped to fight against you. You would think that after watching the movies you should be able to cut a bloody swath through most of your enemies. But not so. It turns out a large amount of things you face in combat just happen to be lightsaber resistant. Which manages to kill the fantasy a bit. There is nothing like being unable to get past the guard of a bug creature because he claw can't be cut. You would think everyone in the Empire fights lightsaber wielding Jedi everyday. For finishing the tougher enemies there is also a button sequence you will have to go through. I often find myself hoses as I go from madly attacking directly into the sequence with no warning. Which causes my poor guy a world of pain until I get on the right page. It also distracts from the action on screen. The boss fight sequences are some of the best of the whole game and its easy to be caught up watching the action and miss hitting the right button.

I experienced a number of glitches during my playthroughs as well. I managed to get stuck in walls several times. And there were a few stages I wasn't able to force manipulate items needed to complete the stage. For the latter issues I was forced to quit my game and load it again to sort out the issue. Not too bad but with the poor save system it could mean playing through the entire stage again.

Overall I did enjoy my time with Force Unleashed and will probably take a couple more play troughs. But being this game is already short I would recommend it as a rental most people.

I bought Sniper: Ghost Warrior for my PS3.  I was originally going to wait for a price drop, but I ended up using a gift certificate to get it to a price that I was willing to take a risk for.

The game is fun.  The bullet physics are amazing, and it can be very challenging to line up long shots.  This simply adds to the satisfaction when you do pull off a nice hit.  The stealth factor is good, but the terrain glitches and forced-to-be-linear feel of the maps detracts from being able to use stealth creatively.  Still, it is easy to get a thrill from sneaking around some of the maps in the game.

Sniper Elite is the better sniping-game of the two, but Sniper: Ghost Warrior is a nice first-attempt for current generation systems.

Break-down and Suggestions for the Developer:

Graphics and sound are good, but nothing special.

Setting and Story are awesome.

Maps NEED to be open ended.  Snipers rely on creativity and adaptation for mission success and survival.  There are almost always multiple approaches to achieve missions.  Let COD and its progeny keep doing their linear thing, no need to imitate that.

AI is bi-polar; sometimes they seem like idiots, sometimes they seem omniscient.

Fire, relocate, fire, relocate...  Again, there is no need to follow the run 'n gun of other FPS games in the Sniper genre.

How apt it feels then to have them do a Lego version of Rock Band and surprisingly it doesn't suck. But then again it's not perfect by any stretch and there's some annoyances that really grind my gears so to speak but then I'm an adult and when you mention the term ""Lego Rock Band"", it feels like you're 4 talking about quantum physics, it just doesn't look right, does it? Keep in mind there's nothing wrong with the game and I actually smiled quite a few times playing the game but then as far as gameplay is concerned I noticed some step downs from Rock Band 2 and even the Beatles game that I wish weren't part of this game. Families won't mind but if you're looking for more songs to play than you're kind of out of luck.

This is kind of a simple review since it's not really that story extensive or there's much to talk about so I'll just mention the gameplay. Personally, as a frequent Rock Band 2 player I'm not exactly digging the interface. Keep in mind I'm mainly a drummer in these kind of games so I'll chat about that with some mentions later of the guitar. If you play on expert you know how vitally important it is to distinguish when to hit a certain pad and cymbal together and when it's just one or the other in more complicated sections. I don't know if it's just me but I found it really hard to tell what to play when the bass pedal got more active and there was more notes as opposed to Harmonix games where I could easily tell and more than once I couldn't tell if it was just one note or a double tap or if the note was exactly on the bass pedal or in front of it. As far as the guitar is concerned, this was where it got tricky since at times it was hard to tell what was 2 separate notes and what was hammer-ons/pull-offs and while it's easily understood in lazier sections, when things get kicked up a notch, you're like ""wait, are these all hammer-ons or separate notes?""

Another annoyance is in regards to the setlist during story in that it doesn't give you the option to automatically pick the next set. For example, the game is telling me to advance I need to play a Rock Challenge (describe those in a minute) at a certain set yet I can't see it, well turns out I had to go to my Rock Den where you can buy your instruments, decorate your lair and customize your character, pick another vehicle and play the set. Why isn't it like Rock Band 2 where upgrading your vehicle automatically upgrades your tour dates? For the rock challenges, these are actually quite fun even though they're just regular old playthroughs of songs, catch is you have to perform and through the power of rock, something special as to happen. The first you'll run into is to demolish a building with a Hives song (because it rocks? or because it's terrible and the building couldn't take it?). The one that practically had me smiling ear to ear though was where you have to exorcise ghosts from a mansion and what better way to do that than Ray Parker Jr's ""Ghostbusters"".

As far as the setlist, it's incredibly odd. There's some songs for the younger kiddies like Ghostbusters and even Kung Fu Fighting and Pink and songs that I'd personally would love to have in Rock Band 2 such as Summer of 69, You Give Love a Bad Name, and wouldn't you know it, another Foo Fighters song (seriously Harmonix, we don't need their entire catalogue as DLC, stop) but then you get indie bands barely anybody knows about and while I'm glad to see more Queen, I'm not lying when I say We Will Rock You is one of the most repetitive drum charts I've ever seen. Not to mention it's actually a short setlist and while DLC from RB1/RB2 will work, only select ones that have been cleared will transfer over which makes for some weird moments when the random song set gave me Won't Get Fooled Again, still one of the hardest Expert drum songs there is and at 7-8 minutes long, a curious entry to a family game with decidely short attention spans. Speaking of, there's a Super Easy mode where all you really have to do is hit the notes, regardless of what it is and you'll pass which sounds good for players but considering No Fail option is here, it feels kind of superflous. Oh and there's an option to have automatic kick drums too. Too bad this wasn't available for Visions, eh?

I think most people will just buy this game so they can export the setlist to Rock Band 2 or if they're into family games. While there's some songs here I'd love to have as DLC, the game itself feels like a step back despite the fact it's undeniably adorable.","Perfect for families, so-so for the rest",1257724800,20,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

The best thing about this game is the graphics and the complexity.  The customization of characters is amazing for a vita title, you don't see much of that.  The multitude of weapons, modules, and upgrades you can do will keep you busy for a long time.

However after a while it gets repetitive.  You start noticing that there are not that many enemies, you fight the same ones over and over and over.  The world is also super tiny, your quests will make you run through the same tiny world over 1000 times.  Also the storyline is just standard, nothing special and nothing memorable.  Music is also generic.  You also cannot customize the button layout, which is lame and it takes a long time to get used to.

My biggest gripe though is the aiming system:  target lock for melee sucks, doesn't work for crap except the first hit because you will be going through the enemy and lock will break.  And if you're using a ranged weapon, you can't shoot AND aim at the same time unless you have 2 thumbs, thanks to the inability to configure your buttons.

On the plus side, the ""jewels"" are clear and mostly very easy to distinguish, even if blocked by locks/chains. The twinkle effect was annoying to me, so I followed up on the tip another reviewer left and pressed the X-button. That turns off the twinkle, and that setting seems to persist even after exiting and restarting the game.

There are some standard bonuses/power-ups that you earn as you play each level: remove a gem only, remove a gem and whatever is locking it, blast an entire row, remove all of a specific type of gem. I never encountered a bonus that removed a column or that blasted an area of the board (3x3 or something of that ilk) that I have seen in other match-3 games. Both would have been very helpful since a lot of the boards have single vertical columns of gems on them or other difficult to access areas. But I was able to get thru 150 levels with the bonuses available.

Very occasionally I received a message, while playing a level, that some other type of power-up was now available. Storm, etc. Blow into the DS microphone and the backgrounds of the gems you haven't cleared yet would be blown away. I found these very occasional, mysteriously appearing, power-ups to be so sporadic that they weren't helpful. I couldn't plan my approach to a level counting on that power-up to be made available.

When you finish level 150 the credits roll. No hoopla. No ""congratulations"".

As others have said, there is no story and there are no extras to this game. It's 150 match-3 levels. Period. You can play in timed or relaxed (untimed) mode. Any level you beat in timed mode can be selected again and played independently by choosing ""Hotseat"" in the menu. Some players may find it a plus to be able to choose a particular level to revisit. In timed mode you start with 3 lives and earn additional as you progress. Then if you run out of time on a level you can exchange lives for extra minutes of playing time. That was a nice plus. If you run out of lives: game over. But if you choose to play again you are given the option to continue and the game picks up from your last level, starting you out with 3 lives again.

There isn't anything wrong with the game (hence, 3 stars), I just didn't find anything special about the game to make me want to play it again. In fact, I debated many times whether I wanted to finish it at all, but I figured I'd bought it so I might as well.",Average match 3 game,1322524800,5,,

3.0,True,"04 9, 2015",A3185QOPBWIUB0,B00NMV2F9I,K,"This is an okay game. Basically you complete little challenges from various NES games. For instance, one is ""kill 10 enemies while using a superstar"" from Mario Bros 1. This sounds like a good idea in theory, but 70% of the challenges are very tedious and easy to complete. I have almost all of the games that are on this disc in full format, which is probably part of why this isn't as good for me. But even for those folks who don't, it might just be easier to play the original games. I could see this as a good tutorial for beginning players, but I was able to play Super Mario Bros when I was young, so trial and error can work too (plus you save some cash).

The other, much smaller part of the game is the Remixes. The Remixes that are included (such as beating part of a Mario level playing as Kirby) are more fun, but you have to play through the tedious challenges to unlock them (unless there's a cheat?), limiting the potential. If you are really into the old-school NES games, this might be worth getting. But I'm pretty ""into"" the older Nintendo games and I found the game to be average.

First the darn thing had trouble installing, the third time around I thought I had it, until I started playing, the character build keeps going out.  The other problem is my screen refresh rate is too fast for the game, yet my computer warns me of consequences if  I lower it.
And on top of everything else, the game is really having problems with the laser mouse.

I just finished, again, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" PC-CDROM game (from 2002) today, the same day I'm trying to play the Longest Journey.  No problems with Harry.

I installed the two patches for the Longest Journey and I tried to cut down on screen enhancements, which might have made things worse.

It also maybe because of SP2 that the game is so uneven. The outline of the character is very 'choppy' as another poster describes.  I can't find a remedy.  I have spent 10 hours trying to get the game to stop cutting out on me and/or the main character's body disappearing sans her shoes and hair.

Good adventure games are not being produced like they used to be for  PC's.  Some of these older games are fantastic but they need to be re-released to able to run on faster speeds without cutting out.

You can tell that the game is overwhelmed.  The fact that there aren't any screen resolutions to choose from really limits its look to an almost 600X400 res.

I was really looking forward to playing this game but I can't take the flaws any more.

The recommended requirements for the Longest Journey are a P2 at 266mhz and a 4MB video card.  No wonder I'm having problems.

This is a good game but it needs be to re-released just to play on a middle of the road drive such as my own.  The game is too slow for my multi-drive to even be installed properly.

* As postscript to the review above, I am having better luck playing the game in a Windows 98/ME compatibility mode option (available through though the desktop icon, under the properties selection, and then the compatibility tab).

You realize that you're skipping battles because you don't want to have to pull strategy, you just want to get to the next part of the story.  But you do need to grind too a bit, so you're forced to battle. And because so many areas look similar, you can get lost VERY easily.

The story is interesting, but because of the way the game is designed you find yourself doing the same things over and over again.  You can skip certain dialogues, but you'll have to find your friends again, and other repetitive and annoying tasks.

Well, sort of. Its anti-slip base helps maintain stability, the buttons and scroll wheel feel good and responsive, and it has a few (but only a few, two to be exact) extra buttons. It also comes with a large, grippy mouse pad that offers plenty of room to roam. Plus, it looks pretty sharp. It's for SURE better than your standard PC mouse and is overall rock solid for most gamers.

However, the mouse feels much too light, borderline flimsy. I feel like a gaming device should feel sturdier and more durable. That's not only so it lasts, but because a little more weight aids in having better precision. No adjustable weight, either, unlike other gaming devices. Throw in a lack of macro support, no out-of-the-box ability to customize to specific games, and no thumb rest, and the most hardcore PC gamers are going to be disappointed in this.

Meanwhile, more casual gamers are going to wonder why they spent $50 for a mouse that doesn't offer THAT much more than a mouse that costs half the price does.

The game is similar in several ways but is different in a few smaller ways. The biggest difference is that this game takes place in the desert outside New Vegas itself which makes it have an entirely different feel than 3.

The game has similar weapons with a few different entry level weapons and super weapons, but overall it's all the same. You may customize your weapons by adding scopes and silencers and a myriad of other things which you could not do in 3. Their are also factions that you can get along with and either close off quests or open them up as opposed to just being ""good or evil."" Vegas itself seems a little small to me, only 3 casinos that are very different and only 3 types of gambling, it seems a little underwhelming overall.

The reasons I did not like this game as much as 3 is that it pretty much is the same exact game with very few changes. The faction system and new weapon upgrades are about the only differences other than the setting and the parties involved. I understand that if the formula works why change it, but honestly, only die hard people who love the game would be happy, people looking for new things will have to wait for something else. My other big complaint is that although their are several places listed on the map, their does not seem to be as many places to explore as in Fallout 3. In 3 you had downtown, all the memorials, several outlying factories, caves and a much richer story with several side quests. This game seems to have a lot less ""dungeon"" type places and a lot fewer side quests, the main quest also seems shorter than in 3.

Great graphics, gameplay, story, and games that REALLY got you into the game.  Well, unfortuantly, every game in the world can't be a classic, as is the case here, but when I bought it, poped it in to my XBOX, and began playing...I couldn't stop!  It was fun, it was creative, and while it may not be the greatest game in the world, it was a game worthy of buying in my book.  Here's what I thought of Star Wars: Obi-Wan for the Microsoft XBOX:
1) Gameplay: This game takes you through the life of Obi-Wan.  You start out on a planet of gang members, trying to stop them from killing your friends and co-workers.  You learn all of the sweet moves: Air jump, force grab (takes guns out of enemies hands), force push (knocks enemies on the floor or off cliffs), and force weapon (uses objects in the area like rocks, or crates, and rams them into enemies).  You'll also discover Obi-Wan can do back and front flips, and has one of the coolest toys in the world...a *LIGHT SABER*!  You walk around in a 3rd person view controlling Obi-Wan with the left thumb stick, and control the Light Saber (when you pull it out) with the right thumb stick.  And the control here is FLAWLESS!  Pushing to the right causes you to attack enemies in that direction, pushing up will bring his lightsaber to come crashing down on enemies.  Of course if your fighting someone else with a lightsaber, you have to block his attacks, use the force (literally), and get the hits in before your get killed yourself.  It's all very challenging and fun once u get farthur into the game...the coolest part being when u learn to THROW your lightsaber like a boomerang across the room, knock out a few guards, that have it fly back for more force flying, back-flipping, light clashing battle.
Now, with these skills, you must somehow beat 15+ missions and help Obi-Wan save the world...again.  Very fun in the long run!
And, once u beat the game, you can unlock new characters, arenas, and such for multiplayer.  I'll go into that later!
2) Graphics: This is where the game failed.  There is no excuse for a game to lack graphics on the Microsoft XBOX.  They're better than most N64 games, maybe even most PlayStation games, but any system other than that could have supported this with no trouble at all!  To begin with, the faces of the people are...there.  They're choppy, small dots for eyes, beards are brown blocks, etc...  It's ugly!
The worst part here, though, is all the freezing this game has.  It has major glitches.  If your in the middle of a big battle, things will start to slow down, the music and sounds will start to get choppy.  When a lot is going on, the framerate drops, and everything looks like a game that...in a word...stinks!  The graphics, for the most part, are pretty good.  But nothing has any detail.  There are no faces, no animals in the grass, no real living water.  And the framrate gets so choppy at times, you can't even play...really annoying.  Counsidering the power of the XBOX, all the glithces and lack of detail are in-excusable.  This game might have even worked on the N64, and in today's world, ladies and gentlemen, thats sad (especially on the XBOX).
3) Multiplayer: Extremely fun.  As you progress through the game, you unlock characters and arenas to fight in.  While it's only for 2 players, it is pretty fun.  You can knock your openants down, fling objects into them, have light-saber battles, hop all over the place, fling your lightsaber like a boomerang, etc..  It's all fun and good, but 4 players would have been, in one word, AWSOME.  And the fact that they didn't include 4 players is just another blown effort.  This, with a little work, could have been a 5-star game.  But it seems like the makers got lazy toward the end, and just didn't add what could have been added.
Overall, this is a great game, especially since you can soon find it on the ""*Platinum Hits*"" lineup (a group of games that, starting soon, you will be able to pick up for less then twenty bucks!).  It's a really fun game, and even the multiplayer is pretty cool.  More options here would have been better.
Hopefully they'll make an Obi-Wan 2, and put the work into a good game, that could have made this a *CLASSIC* game.  A good game none the less, reccomended to all action gamers, and of course, *MAJOR* Star Wars fans.  This won't disapoint, as long as your not expecting greatness.

I mean, graphically Lost Planet is pretty nice. Beautiful, actually. There are some boss battles that are pretty astounding in how they are presented. There's one moment at the very beginning where a creature named Green Eye appears and the size of this thing is enough to make your jaw drop. There's also another moment when you're running across an open field getting chased by this monstrous worm thing that is an experience on its own. This is definitely a game that benefits from being played on an HDTV setup with surround sound.

But then the story kicks in and you can't deny that it makes very little sense, not to mention the fact that the hero of the story is really not an interesting character to begin with. The gameplay itself is a bit repetitive and really, the game just amounts to little more than eye and ear candy. Even when you're not on foot and riding around in the mechs, it just doesn't add up to any memorable experience.

The online portion of the game isn't enough to make you want to play it a lot, especially with games like Gears of War and Rainbow Six: Vegas out there. It's kind of stale and just not that interesting.

The Bad: The game drags out too long, lame story, bland visuals and audio, makes you want to eat cake

CakeMania has the same play style as Diner Dash so fans of that game know what kind of fun they are walking into here. CM's premise is as follows: You are Cloe who's grandparents' cake shop must be torn down due to it's age, lack of customers, and not being up to code. So, as the sweet girl Cloe is, she decides to spice things up at the shop adding new ingredients and working it all by herself. The game play is very similar to Diner Dash where you have a step by step style game play. A customer comes in, you give him a menu, you wait for him/her to select their cake, you go to the oven and you select the shape they want, after that you carry it to the icing machine and select the color icing, after this they may want a decoration (which you have to end up buying before you can use them).

The later stages have you making double stack cakes, but the game isn't just as simple as all this. You have a certain cash goal you have to make and customers will leave bigger tips depending on their attention level (hearts above their head) so the more hearts the bigger the tip. Some characters have more hearts than others and there are holiday specific cakes and characters. Some characters effect others like Santa adds 1 heart to everyone, and the vampire at Halloween makes them irritated faster. The whole game is about memorization and organization. You have to decide who's more important than who and bake the cakes accordingly. If you screw up you put the cake on a stand (that you have to buy) so it doesn't go to waste and usually a customer will eventually buy it saving you time. If you screw up too much you have to toss the cake costing you money and time. If you take too long customers will get angry and leave losing money in the process.

When you finish a stage you can save up and buy new cookingware such as upgraded ovens, icing machines, a muffin oven to hand out free samples to make customers happier, more decorations etc. This is what keeps you playing CM which is to keep getting further and further, so in turn the pace keeps going up and so does your cash goal for the day. You get a certain amount of time to pump out cakes before the store closes, so if you have customers left after you close that's it for the stage. The game has many stages and of course the game isn't perfect.

While that's the main concept of the game it's played out pretty much flawlessly, but its everything surrounding it that is average. The graphics are nothing much; just a bunch of drawn up sprites with one or two animations per character, and the game looks and plays like something from a GameBoy Advance or *cough* DS. There aren't any effects at all unless you count the icing machine's ""spray"" an effect. The game's not ugly, but not pretty to look at either which is a shame. Other games like this such as Cooking Mama, and even Brain Age have some 3D elements I don't know why the Diner Dash engine hasn't been updated to 3D yet. Thankfully the PSP's widescreen helps you see everything on screen with ease without any scrolling so this makes things more spread out and not so crammed.

The audio is just as plain as the visuals with annoying one-track-repeating BGM, a few whooshing and whizzing sound effects and that pretty is the whole pie...or cake.

Gray,"The first SH game I played was number 3(which was awsome by the way)  Then I read about SH 1 and how it was one of the top 10 rare rp games to own, so of course, I had to have it.  However, I was rather dissappointed when I put the game in and started to play.  The graphics on this game are really bad and the story, for me, was a bit confusing.  Also, there is just so much reading involved and you can't just skip through it.  Sure, you can just not read it, but then you wouldn't know what's going on.  I guess that's why the story was confusing for me, I did just skim through all the talking scenes, which there are A LOT!!

Your main character Yuri is kinda cool, I guess.  He transforms into different monsters so long as you have enough MP and SP for it.  The bad thing is he has so many fusions to choose from that it makes it kinda hard to know which three to equip on him.  I just simply had my three favorite equipped to him at all times.

Then you have some characters that are simply worthless that I hardly played with at all, like Margarete and Zhuzhen Liu.  Even Alice is pretty much useless until she learns her ability to cure the whole party.

Then there are your awsome characters.  Yuri, the hero, of course.  Haley, who is just a kid, but very powerful.  And then there is Keith, the silver bat, who makes a cameo apperance in Sh 3.  And the only way to learn new abilities for your people is to play them and when they reach a certain level, they will aquire a new skill.  That works out great for the team you use the most, but it will take forever getting new skills for your less played characters.

This game is very dark and sinnister, very different from SH 2, which was quite humerous, and SH 3 which was set during the Great Depression.  I can't say this game is all that bad, it has some rather interesting features, such as the judgement ring.

The judement ring determines the fate of your attack.  If you miss, then your turn ends, but if you're able to hit your mark, your attack is successful.

Another thing that's great is that you can aquire like over 200 items to use on the field, or during combat.  Some of these items are quite powerful and should only be used during boss fights.

Unlike the other 2 games you don't have crest magic or stellar charts to equip to your characters.  Which can be good so you don't have to keep track of what's equipped to who and leveling up your magic.  However, like in the other 2 games (at least in SH 3) you can have the same magic equipped to 2 or 3 of your people, like Cure or Cure ALL, so you don't have to rely on just one person healing the party and having to keep that person in play the entire game.  Sure you can use your items, but they normally don't affect the party as much as using your magic.

If you are interested in any of the SH games, I suggest playing 3 first, simply because it's not connected storywise to the first two.  If you played this one first, chances are you would not play the others.

I also enjoy Pokemon, and other various RPG, strategy RPG, and other games in the adventure realm (Zelda, Shin Megami Tensei, etc...).  Basically I have an open mind with games.  Chibi doesn't bother me.  Goofy stories don't bother me.  What does bother me?  Mediocre gameplay... which seems to be a common trend with modern Final Fantasy titles more often then not.

So this game is almost as linear as Final Fantasy XIII.  Truly.  There is no exploration.  No real variety.  There are a couple of alternate paths through the areas you can take, but they diverge only slightly.

Where the game excels is at the monster collection and team building aspect.  You basically collect these mirages and use them by stacking them on your character's head.  Yup.  You want to create a good, cohesive team.  This is fun.  Battles on the other hand are rather mundane.  You unlock some skills along the way, but it really just seems like everybody is just trading off melee attacks more often than not.

So why three stars?  Well because there is a good concept and some really fun moments.  The graphics are amazing.  Music is decent.  But the linear maps, mundane combat, and overly generic story do little to help what could have been pure Final Fantasy gold.  Love it or hate it, it is a polarizing game in the FF realm.

There have been some good Final Fantasy spin off games in recent years, many of these for the PSP and DS / 3DS.  So I was overjoyed to see a spin off title on the PS4.  Sadly, it doesn't live up to its pedigree.

Munro,"Here's a review from someone who has actually played the game for a few hours and aren't coming here to post 1 star ""reviews"" because they're upset about the DLC or pricing.  I knew what I was getting into when I bought the game and that's that.

Everyone knows the premise of the game - been plenty of media on that.  4 hunters vs. 1 monster and vice versa, so I won't elaborate more.

Pros:
- Graphics are quite good as well as sound effects.
- Entertaining maps.
- Interesting concept, almost like playing against or as a boss monster in every round.
- Unique hunter skill sets.
- Ability to play as a monster or hunter.

Cons:
- Monster POV is frustrating.
- Best play is co-op, but opportunities of having your own team/friends to do this are small.
- Play gets repetitive.
- Awfully noisy, especially solo. Lots of character shouts, multiple weapons going on, monsters screaming. After a while, it sounds like you've put your head in a trash compactor and it won't stop.

All in all, I'd quantify it as a good, but not great game.  Not yet at any rate.  My biggest beef is with the monster POV.  Hard to tell when to jump, when to climb because it is difficult to judge distances, and more often than not, I'd find my monster facing a wall when I tried to use one of the special attacks.

The co-op portion is frustrating. I won't play co-op games unless I'm with people I know because what you get off the servers is 99 times out of 100, some 12 year old foul-mouthed kid who thinks they know everything. So this being a new (and expensive) game, means that co-op opportunities for me are going to be little to none until my friends slowly pick up the game as the price drops.  BUT...if you can get a group together, it's a very entertaining co-op.

So solo - I give the game 3 stars, co-op with friends I give it 4 stars, for an average of 3.5 stars.

As an RTS game, however, there's not much different here.  True, you don't have to build bases, harvest resources and create units, which can be a pain.  But just like all previous RTS games, End War finishes the same way-- ordering a rush of units against the enemy. You can try to do this in a strategic way, but there's no real point to it.

The single player campaign is a disappointment too.  The underlying story is disjointed and boring-- you certainly aren't engrossed in the outcome of this conflict.  The missions revolve around securing uplinks (which are forced into the overall plot in a way that makes little sense), destroying buildings in raids or eliminating all enemies on the board.  Finesse not really required.  Further, there's not much choice on how the war is prosecuted on a strategic level-- you just pick one of a handful of missions the computer sets out for you.  And for some reason, I won the campaign after 12 missions without once tackling any of the hard missions.  I couldn't believe it when the credits started rolling!

It loses a point for some repetitive play and its short length.  I would like to concentrate, however, on the multiplayer game, which I rate a 3 out of 5 -- and that is being generous.  If you were to list the ""glitches"" in Halo PC it will add up into the hundreds.  Yes, it's fun, but it is VERY buggy.

There are so many problems with Halo PC that it would take pages and pages to outline each one.  I will list below a few below.

1) The year is 2552.  I guess we haven't made much progress on vehicle design and operation.  The warthog overturns way too easily.  The ghost and banshee get ""stuck"" on corners.  A banshee going full speed is stopped dead by a branch of leaves and it sounds like it hit a rock.  Okay.

2) In the PC game, we often get the ""mystery of the half-flipped vehicle.""  Shoot a warthog from a distance with a heavy weapon and you will often see the vehicle begin to flip over only to instantly right itself and continue going as if nothing at all happened.  Okay.

3) Forced Flag pick-up in CTF.  If you get too close to the flag, you are FORCED to pick it up, even if you don't want to.  This nullifies your weapons.  It would be much better to have to press an ""action key"" to pick up the flag.  Many a people have been killed because they accidentally picked up the flag.

4) The ""reacquire flag"" bug.  If you have the flag and want to drop it in order to shoot an opponent, good luck.  As soon as you drop it, you will instantly pick it up again.  Even if you try to throw it, you will pick it up again.  Even if you run forward and throw the flag and then back up, you will pick it up again.  Many a people have been killed because they reacquired the flag when they didn't want to.

5) Are rockets propelled by rubberbands?  They go so slowly, you'd think so.

6) Want to drive a ghost or warthog in a base.  Better be careful.  Even though your head height in the vehicles is many feet below the ceiling, you can't see.  You get all kinds of vision interference.  Hard to steer or shoot if you can't see.

7) So how did you get up there?  That's what you might ask when you see people in the sky.  Yeah, it's a ""sealing glitch"" that can be taken advantage of, if you know how.

8)  You can usually make a kill with one rocket, or two fuel rod hits.  But if you really want a powerful weapon, use your fist.  You can follow an opponent up a ladder and hit him in his feet and instantly kill him.  A hit in a foot is more powerful than a rocket or fuel rod or sniper rifle.  Yeah, that makes sense.

9)  What about the dud granades?  Yep... sometimes you can throw a nade and it won't blow...this often happens if you die after you throw the nade.  Not all nades are the same strength either, it appears.  Sometimes a nade will blow right at the feet of an opponent and won't kill.  Other times, it blows 20 ft. away and WILL kill.  Never really know what you're getting.

10)  The ""run-over"" glitch.  Very frustrating glitch that occurs when you head in a vehicle straight for an opponent only to find when you hit him, he will disappear and reappear about 20 feet away unharmed.  Sometimes this can happen over and over again as you try to hit him.  Another glitch is when you apparently DO hit an opponent and you see him fly in the air about 50 feet -- only to suddenly disappear and reappear on the ground unharmed.  Some will say this is a ""lag"" problem, but I find this happening all the time with my 1.5 mb line at under 75 ping.

11) What is all this Tking!  It appears there is no adequate method to deal with it.  I'd say at least half of all games have Tkers on them.  And if that's not bad enough, there are the spys.

12) The spies change teams for a short period to see what the defenses are or to find where a flag is hidden.  Then they change back and let their teammates know what's up.

13) Watch out, you may get the boot.  You might be thinking I'm talking about Tking too much.  Nope.  If you're ""too good"" the admin of the server may just boot you right off.  A lot of games are ""stacked"" so that the admin's team will always win.  They just boot the good players off the opposing team.  Happens all the time.  On a bad day, I can get booted off five or more times by the admin just because I have ""too many kills"" or I killed the admin.  Okay.

14) Stupid Rules.  Sometimes you just have to laugh at some rules people make up.  ""No driving vehicles,""  ""No using fuel rods or rockets""  ""No camping.""  That one is the funniest.  You CANNOT play defense...it's not fair.. LOL.  ""This is only an offensive game.  No defense is allowed.""  LOL.  When that is said, just ask what ""camping"" is.  You will probably get an answer like.  ""It's standing still.""  Or  ""It's staying in a location too long.""  So you can't stop running or hide behind a rock or a tree... or wait for a ride.  It gets so ridiculous that you just have to laugh at the stupidity of the players on your server.

15)  The ""following behind"" glitch.  When facing an opponent guns are much more accurate.  It is possible to kill an opponent with full health and shield in 3 pistol shots -- even from 50 ft away.  But running ""behind"" an opponent is completely different.  I have run behind an opponent as close as only 10 feet away and pumped more than 30 rounds into his head without a kill.  Doesn't seem to matter if they're head shots or body shots.  No kill.

16)  The ""stuck in the wall"" glitch.  Sometimes a tank or warthog or ghost can break the plane of a wall and get ""stuck.""  Once stuck, there is no way to break it loose.  The vehicle is lost.  One game I played had no less than five vehicles all stuck in walls.  Again, poor design.

Since I'm running out of time, I'll stop here.  It may sound to you as if I don't like Halo multiplayer.  That's not true.  In fact, I still play it more than any other online game.  However there are so many bugs and issues with it that, even though it is usually fun, I have to knock off a few points for some of the shortcomings.  Some might argue that ALL games have some glitches.  True... but not to this extent.  These bugs are mostly confined to the PC version of Halo, not the Xbox version.

The Bad: Very hard, very linear, frustrating controls, weird quirks

One idea that has not really been explored in video games are fairies and why this is beyond me. When I saw Folklore debuted at E3 '05 I was stunned by the beautiful visuals and charming idea of capturing fairies ""ID"" and using them to attack. After the game's release two years later is received luke warm reviews with most people complaining of the difficulty and repetition, and I have to agree.

Game play wise Folklore takes a step in the right direction, but then trips with flawed execution. You can capture dozens of fairies and store them for later use. Each realm has different types of fairies and they are used not only to fight certain enemies, but bosses as well. Some fairies are weak against some and immune to others. You can assign fairies to each face button and execute them as attacks. This is the step in the right direction, but the trip up is the flawed mechanics. Every time you attack with a fairy the character stops and then the animation is played out. This can be very frustrating when fighting fast-moving fairies or bosses. Another flawed element is you don't know what fairy is good against each other because there is no data letting you know. You have fairies classified under elements, but you don' t know which can fight which unless you equip and unequip each fairy and this is daunting.

If that sounds bad enough navigating through the levels is extremely hard despite the extreme linearity of the game. Most levels are like mazes that give you no direction on which to go and re-spawning enemies every time you reenter an area is a disaster. Really? Re-spawning enemies? C'mon. You have to fight each area to acquire the IDs to break certain gems or fight bosses. After you have visited an area once you can just run by them all. Another thing that I hate is there is no way to use items. You can collect karma items, but I have no idea what they are used for. Health can only be generated by save spots or when enemies drop them and this is rare. If you die you have to start all over again from the last save point.

The other useless and annoying element to the game is the MP bar. It regenerates, but there is no special magic attacks so using your only attacks that drain a bar is absurd. After a few hits you have to wait for it to regenerate and this can be very annoying when fighting enemies that have timed down times.

If you want to talk about something that really annoys me? There are 8 chapters in the game and each character has 6, but when you get to chapter 7 you have to play 1-6 with the other character. Playing through an already frustrating game twice to see the ending? Almost not worth it. The game does have a great mystery murder type story that will keep you guessing all the way through, but there are even problems with that. Lots of text readings and hardly any cut scenes. The scenes are pre-rendered CGI which is what next generation technology is supposed to illuminate. You also get weird comic style panels that you can fast forward and then RPG type avatar conversation screens.

There are positive notes that make the game worth at least renting, and the biggest one is the great use of the Sixaxis motion sensing. This is probably the most use I've seen from any PS3 game so far. When you defeat a folklore you will see a red soul come out of it and that is the sign to hit R1 and pull the controller up. Some bigger folklore and bosses have you whacking the soul side to side, pulling up at timed moments, and shaking the controller vigorously.

The game's best feat is probably its looks with gorgeous landscapes and beautifully designed folklore, but that's really not enough to keep you playing. Once you get to chapter 7 and realize you have to go through the game again with the other character it makes you decide whether to tread on or give up.

You go through the story line as each type of fighter and fight the other types. You start as a knight and go through and fight other knights. Eventually you link up with a certain group of knights and then you come across the vikings and fight them and then that is the last mission for the knights and it goes onto the viking mission. So the viking mission starts fighting their own type. then form a group of vikings, and then they go after the samaurais. The samaurai mission repeats the same scenario, but ends up fighting the vikings and the knights and then gets to fight the ""boss"" lady. Once you beat her, that's the end. When you start your mission, you choose a character and as the story progresses, you get to play as other top characters in your type, but not as the boss. So you aren't stuck as playing the same character the whole time, but it does revert back to your main character.

You keep the same weapon throughout the mission.

At the start of your mission you pick 2 skills to have. As you go through the missions you unlock new skills. There's 13 skills so once you unlock the 13 it repeats and gives another level of each skill. You get the points to unlock the skills by finding different objects during the missions. You also get your points while fighting for kill streaks, combos, etc.

While you're going through the missions and fighting opposing groups, you can fight as free for all just swinging and hitting people in the groups, or you can lock on and fight someone from the group one on one. There are times you cant beat the opponent without locking on, but generally you do not have to do one on one. You can go through as free for all.

This isn't my usual genre but it looked interesting so decided to give it a try. The reason for 3 (and a half) stars is that it seems like offline story line could have been a bit more involved and longer. You can easily get through the story within a day, especially if you're more experienced with these types of games.

When it was new, it was reviewed highly and well received by all but the PC gamer.
There are many doors in the game and 90% of them either leads to dead ends or are locked. Don't bother looking for a key that's how the game works. Very difficult to determine where the game wants me to go. There is no map or sense direction you need to go. On two occasions the exit was well hidden and took several minutes to find.
The compass displayed is useless but does show your health and from what direction you are hit.
There are objectives that must be done to end the level.
Issues:
Backtracking is very frequent. If you clear an area and not destroy say a radio, you have to go all the way back to the level to accomplish the task.
Save points are brutal. You die at any point before completing the level, you start over from the beginning.
Head shots at close range not working.
Enemies only stunned after being shot in the head with a shotgun or sniper rifle like they were zombies killed it for me. Strangely, a pistol head-shot takes them out.
Objectives are general and providing no information what to look for or how to get there.

Those of you who haven't played the first installment yet should go out and buy the original (I recommend MC Gold, which added some missions and fixed some bugs), not because it's necessary but it's better. For the rest of you, I'll put this review in terms of differences from MC Gold.

First off, the graphics are much better and are true 3D, not isometric. Whether you like this or not is simply your aesthetic taste, because it's never really necessary to rotate the camera. 'Mech customization is more realistic and costs money, which adds another layer of force management (but simple shoot-and-smash players will find annoying).

Speaking of shoot-and-smash, one of the great things about the original was that there was no ""golden path"": even though your mission log was linear, you could beat any given mission in a number of ways, leading to some decent replay value. MC2's missions seem to lose this, which is a huge loss because every now and then I still crack out MechCommander 1 almost a decade later.

MC2 does make three big improvements over the original. Salvage is now much more realistic. In MC1, you'd be lucky to get one in every 10 you shot. Now, you get about 8 or 9 out of every ten, but you have to pay to salvage them (don't worry, it's not mandatory to salvage everything). Rather than the fog-of-war-blackness in MC1's maps (which made no sense because you could see them in the mission briefing but not the mission itself), MC2 lets you see the entire map but utilizes line-of-sight to spot the enemy. Finally, rather than giving players a fixed number of fire support and counting support vehicles against the player's drop weight, all these are grouped under a new support tab. Since the new salvage system made the resource warehouses and container stacks of MC1 obsolete, the new incarnations of the above give players resource points, which they can use to call in several forms of air support. Mostly these correspond to what we saw in the original, with the minesweeper being replaced by the Karnov Salvage Craft, which allows in-mission salvage of 'Mechs. I found losing the minesweeper a curious choice because, unlike the MC1, there are missions where it would actually be useful here.

In summary, MC2 brought in a lot of cool new features (not all of which I listed here), but did so at the expense of mission depth. So, unfortunately, MC2 is not as good as MC1.",A good sequel for those who liked the first,1235433600,,,

3.0,True,"02 16, 2012",AB0KXC2NVTQ5F,B004WLRQMI,Al-Nabati,"Don't get me wrong; I LOVE the Legend Of Zelda series and readily admit that it is the BEST series Nintendo has.  But that also means that the standards are pretty high.  I admit that I played Skyward Sword before this one, which may have influenced my opinion for the sake that Skyward Sword just feels so natural and smooth to play.  Skyward Sword is a true motion control game; Twilight Princess is not.  If you want to see what I mean, go to the end of the review.  Otherwise:

Let's start with the good--

The storyline follows the same pattern of virtually every Zelda game made since Ocarina of Time:  A few early dungeons to collect some items to stand up to the evil that threatens the land; once you have acquired them you find out that they just won't be enough.  So you embark on the quest to try to find the other items, and so on and so forth.  Considering that they have used this basic outline over and over again, you would think it would get stale.  But honestly, it just doesn't.  This strategy adds a lot of length to the game, so you don't notice that the skeleton is pretty much the same, especially because the layout of Hyrule is not exactly the same in every game.  You'll spend a good amount of time riding around and discovering new shortcuts from place to place.

The dungeons get a PERFECT score for difficulty.  The puzzles here are not cookie-cutter and if you want to solve them in anything less than an hour you have to observe, not just look around.  Obviously for some you will need certain items, that's just the way it's always been done.  But there were some that I had to do over again: these challenges actually expanded as I came back to them again--excellent design because they were harder the second time around.

The wolf transformation adds a nice dynamic to the game and is blended perfectly into the game.  There will be times when you need to be the wolf, but they won't be so overwhelming that you will get annoyed.

The music is... well, Nintendo has taken quite a while to get on the symphony-music bandwagon.  All midis here, which can actually get a little annoying

The side quests are a little annoying as well, to be perfectly honest.  The main example is one where you are escorting a wagon to a village to protect it from attackers as it goes.  Instead of doing what real intelligent beings would do and just go as quickly as possible the game has the wagon go around in circles until you've defeated a certain enemy.  If you don't defeat that enemy, you have to follow the wagon in the same futile circle until you've defeated that enemy which is when you have to move on to yet another futile circle.  And because this side quest was necessary to the storyline of the game, you can't get out of it...

Combat leaves a lot to be desired, especially the bosses.  Their movements were very predictable, and instead of attacking all the time, most of the bosses just sat there and only attacked occasionally.  Basically, all you have to do is find out their patterns and take them out like so.  That's fine for a dungeon puzzle, but when you're in combat you get the most thrill as the game comes closer to a real fight.  The game tries to compensate for that by teaching you certain combo attacks as you go, but it's just not the same.  You swing your remote, but to do a truly satisfying attack you have to do some button combos at the same time--not at all like a real fight.

Which brings me to the main criticism of the game.  I say it would have been better on GameCube because billing this version of the game as 'motion control' gaming is deceptive.  Example:  When playing, swing the remote horizontally and Link swings his sword horizontally; swing the remote vertically, and Link swings his sword HORIZONTALLY; thrust the remote forward to stab, and Link swings his sword HORIZONTALLY.  All the game is doing is triggering an algorithm, something along the lines of ""If the remote beam moves this many pixels, swing the sword,"" but leaves out the direction of the swing.  If you want to do things like stab or swing vertically you have to combine some buttons to the mix, which makes it feel more like an arcade fighter game than a smooth, motion control game where your character's movements actually follow your own.  That fact annoyed me the most when trying to fight, and in all honesty it made fighting quite a bit harder, especially when the enemy has one particular weak spot which you have to hit just right, but can't because the game doesn't have the programming to let you put the sword exactly where you want to on the first strike.  It's honestly like having a car that turns left when you turn the wheel left, but turns left when you turn the wheel right.

This game does have a lot going for it... on the GameCube.  From the major glitches of the fighting it is obvious to tell that this was intended to be a GameCube game, but was then rushed to be available on the Wii.  The only advantage that this gave the game was allowing you to swing your sword while running--great to cut grass quickly and wipe out larger numbers of smaller enemies.  If it weren't for the controller problems this game would be about as close to perfect as it could be:  lots of gameplay, challenging dungeons, entertaining and complex characters, and a massive world that begs to be explored.  But you get all of that on the GameCube version, too, without the headache of having controls that don't always do what they are billed as doing.",Would be better on GameCube,1329350400,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

After the novelty of the Wii remotes wear off, it loses its luster fast.  Its one saving grace is the virtual console which allows you to download all of your favorite games from old consoles.  That is what I spend most of my time doing on the Wii because you don't need to use the Wii motion remotes.  You need to buy the classic controller for the virtual console games, which resembles a super nintendo controller.  If you are looking for a game console for a party or to play with a group of friends, this is the system for you because anyone can play with such a small learning curve.  The Wii is also great for small kids who will enjoy the controls and lack of depth in the games.  The serious gamer will not enjoy the Wii.  The controls become more annoying than fun after a while and many of the games you'd want are available and better on other consoles.  I consider myself a mid level gamer, not hardcore addict but not a novice either.  The main resason I enjoy the Wii is the Virtual Console and the Mario games.  The main reasons I dislike the Wii are the lack of sophisticated games (at least half involve just swinging the Wii remote around in the air) and the graphics are worse than the other gaming systems out there.

One other way to break it down is this:  If you enjoy sports games, role playing games, or shooting games...do not get the Wii.

Yes I admit the graphics and gameplay are terrible! But come on, after 6 years in development you would have a hunch about how badly the game will turn out. Look at Gearboxs' Duke Nukem, yeah I went there. Aside from the noticeable graphical glitches and animations in this game the storyline is not all that great either. You have a few plot twists that are meant to push the story forward, for instance you encounter Weyland mercenaries trying to contain the Aliens and any information the scientists have. It went from fighting Aliens to Call of Duty in about 45 minutes.

Throughout the game you fight a mix of nothing but Aliens and than a few levels of nothing but mercenaries, and at the end you fight a mixture of both. The boss battles are creative but not very fun. The most creative would be the Raven, where you encounter a xenomorph who is trying so hard to kill you. He is invulnerable and instead of bullets or using the environment to destroy it they put you in a Power Loader! You duke it out with the Raven(yes they gave this xenomorph a name) and the fight doesnt make things memorable either. After exhausting my 4 hours on singleplayer I jumped on multiplayer to if that is any better. In truth, it sort of makes up for it. In multiplayer you have many customizable options for both marines and aliens. These range from weapons and weapon mods to their appearance. Its really cool to change the way each marine looks but overall they only change a few minor appearances such as adding a pack of smokes to ones helmet or changing emblems on your body armor. For the aliens they have different attack upgrades and some neat looking aesthetic upgrades to only their heads.

The gameplay with the xenomorphs is fun, you have your primary and secondary attacks and the most satisfying of them all, the fatality attack which can be used whenever you creep up behind a lone marine! The fatality is well done with constricting a marine with your tail or spewing acid into their mouths(oh and there are more than 1 fatality for each xenomorph). I failed to mention that there are only 3 types of xenomorphs to play as: The Soldier(Balanced and strong alien), The Acid Alien(Totally forgot its name,but as the name implies), and the Lurker(Smaller and more agile alien). The attacks and animations for each alien works but when it comes to climbing walls and being more of a predator sneaking in the dark, thats where it fails. You don't get that suspense with trying to crawl through vents or hide in the shadows. Instead you just crawl around awkwardly trying to understand the physics of crawling and than try to hit a marine with your attack.

 This game has some value if you play with A FRIEND NOT FRIENDS, playing with 4 others just feels like a huge crowd and theres no fun involved. But with only 1 other partner you can share the laughs that this game has to offer. Sad as it may sound, Yes if you play with a friend you will do nothing but laugh at this ""Canon to the series"" Aliens game. OK now to cut to the point. DONT BUY THIS GAME AT FULL RETAIL PRICE! BUY IT FOR LESS THAN $20.00(USD). The overall experience is like a shooting gallery but with aliens. Theres not much challenge or horror factor other than how bad the plot twists and plot line are.

Lament of Innocence wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great.  And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth, it has problems.  Sometimes scary problems.  Like Lament of Innocence, it had so much potential to be good--this title more so.  But it doesn't deliver, and that's a sad revelation to admit to, especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash: Dawn of Sorrow.

Ever since the 1997 all time best, Symphony of the Night, so many main characters in the series have to be like Alucard in SOME way.  Hector in Curse of Darkness is no exception.  He looks a little like Alucard.

But we're not here to discuss that.  Hector is a Devil Forgemaster, one who has given up his powers.  Dracula is dead, but the land is overun with the curse of monsters on the world of  Valachia.  Hector, however, isn't concerned about what kind of shape the world is in.  He's more concerned about an evil Devil Forgemaster by the name of Issac, who has killed his beloved.  If you couldn't guess, it's time for revenge.  And so Issac leads Hector into a place full of traps and obstacles he must overcome.  And by doing so, Hector will slowly recover his Devil Forgemaster skills and whatnot.  The story actually unfolds with excellent voice-acting, but there isn't much story.

Since Symphony of the Night we've been given this Metroid style exploration when it comes to Castlevania.  This is marvelous, and once again, makes its way into the 3D world of Castlevania.  You explore a large castle riddled with goodies.  This includes weapons, subweapons, armor and much more.

Playing the game can be quite fun.  Most of the game, as you might have guessed, is spent running through endless hallways of defeating monsters.  That isn't as boring as you might think.  You can perform some cool looking combos on enemies, but each one must be finished with the circle button.  You can also lock onto enemies and perform combos.  This makes the camera go crazy, though, but this is forgiveable. Battling without locking on is actually much better, and it isn't too hard to do without.  Although, if you want to steal from your enemies, you'll have to lcok on to 'em.  Speaking of stealing, it's nice that you can actually do that.  Many a time a monster will leave himself open for stealing.  This usually occurs while it recovers from taking damage.  Again, you must be locked on for it to happen.

Likewise, unlike Lament of Innocence, they actually use the level up system.  In other words, there's actually a point to battling through hordes of monsters this time.

You also have little helper monsters.  You can compare them to the familiars found in other Castlevania games (like Symphony of the Night and Dawn of Sorror), but the better comparison would be Pokemon.  They lend their assistance and gain experience from defeating enemies, just as you do.  It's nice not to have to go at it alone, but we Castlevania veterans would prefer to go at it alone.  Each enemy also drops evolution crystals.  Collect enough of them and your monster will evolve.  You won't grow to like them, though.  That's the sad part, and they don't really enhance the gameplay.  The monsters have special abilities, though.  Golem like creatures can open heavy doors, imps let you bury underground.  But you can't help but admit it would be nice if your little innocent devils were actually characters. Also, no evolution crystal is the same.  You can take advantage of the system by collecting different types of crystals and seeing how your little buddies evolve.

One of the nice things about being a devil forger, you can make your own weapons!  And Hector can do it at any time he wants!  That's right, no running back to some stupid shop to do it!  Monsters often drop raw materials, and you can use them to make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger.  You can do this simply by opening the menu.  I don't know about you, but that's pretty satisfying to me to be able to do that.

The weapons have their own little downside however.  With the exception of the sword, none of them are highly helpful in combat.  You start the game off with a short sword, and you'll grow accustomed to its fast speed and easy use.  Other weapons just aren't fast enough, and enemies aren't weak to a certain weapon ""type"".  This makes the weapon crafting system a little useless at some points.  Unless you're a person who likes to use ""cool"" looking weapons as opposed to swift and powerful weapons, you won't have THAT much use for the weapon crafting system, except to power up your sword. Thus, experimenting with weapons garners no fun.

It is pretty cool, I must say, to be venturing somewhere that isn't Dracula's castle.  Instead you actually venture through the world of Valachia.  Meaning you'll trek through swamps, mountains, valleys and a lot more.  So if you're tired of Dracula's castle, this is quite a change.

The problem with this ""world"" is that you don't see enough of it.  There's not enough detail to it.  You have to follow a beaten path (so it isn't really that different than Dracula's castle in Lament of Innocence), so you can't go off and just explore the places you're at.  The game also suffers from what Lament of Innocence suffered from: the lack of detailed enviroments.  You'll no doubt run down the same path/hall/corridor several times over.  If it weren't for the map you'd find yourself lost, thinking you must be in one of those ""looping"" ares, or that you took a wrong turn and ended up running in a circle.

The monsters are also not so great.  What I love about the 2D Castlevania games (especially in the new Dawn of Sorrow) is how much variety is thrown into the monsters.  The attacks they use on you.  Even if they're the same looking monster, they throw in some new attack that you don't expect.  Curse of Darkness (like Lament of Innocence) has no variety.  You'll run into the same batch of monsters constantly, and they'll never do something new.  Later in the game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates of different colored monsters that do nothing new.  Likewise, all the monsters you'll ever see are encountered pretty early on.  The moment you run into an Axe Armor, you've run into 'em all!  They'll never change.

I sound like I'm being picky about the enemies thing, but I'm not.  It takes away from the challenge of the game.  The fact that reincarnates don't do anything new makes it more true.  And that's not the worst part: the game overall just isn't a challenge.  The bosses can be, at times, but if you've been playing 3D action games, I think you'll find even the more challenging bosses to be no challenge at all.  The early boss battles in the game are fairly easy.  Later on, however, they get  start to get hard, and that's when battling them actually becomes fun.  Again, though, if you're an action/adventure pro, you'll probably beat most of them on your first try.

I wish I could say the graphics are great.  Hey, Hector looks great in combat.  But the enviroments don't have enough detail.  Too many of them are simple everyday enviroments we've been seeing for a long time now.  Where's the detail?  You know... like... maybe the leaves on a tree moving?  We're at that point where there could be some kind of interation with the enviroment, instead of it seeming like we're running through a still-life painting.  Visually, it doesn't look half bad.  It's just that there could be so much more.  The bosses look cool, and the framerate doesn't slow down at all, but there isn't enough variety, or detail.

However, I must say this: the music sounds AWESEOME!  As usual, the Castlevania games have some of the best music there is to be heard in gaming!  Is it better than Symphony of the Night?  No, it's not.  It isn't better than Lament of Innocence either (which also had steller music), but it is still among the best you'll ever hear in a video game.  Likewise, the voice acting is actually really really GOOD!  I just wish I could've heard more of it!

Curse of Darkness had the potential to be a good game.  But there are a lot of things that keep it down.  It's a fairly fun game to play, but it lacks innovation.  You won't be able to separate it from the other action/adventure 3D games.  It's got nothing that makes it stick out.

If you MUST have this game, however, I'd say wait for a price drop.  If you're really looking for a good Castlevania game, I'd suggest getting a hold of ""Dawn of Sorrow"".  It's a much better game.

The Good:
+Great Music!  Some of the best in gaming!
+Good weapon system
+It's pretty fun to play
+You can steal from enemies!
+Great Voice acting!

The Bad
-Little innovation
-Lack of cutscenes to advance the story
-Too much of the game gets recycled too fast
-Too easy
-The game doesn't look bad, but there's little imagination in the environments
-Not a whole lot of different enemies
-It's too easy
-Boring level designs (not enough of them)
-You just can't help that the game has almost no innovation!  It's no different than your average action/adventure 3D game

The other reviews here make some points.
1) It is very funny at times.
2) Some of the minigames are a lot of fun.

The problem is that once you get by these 2 points, there's not much left to the game. I am not a hardcore gamer yet I still beat the single-player story mode in about 4-5 hrs. That was ok with me because I really just wanted to unlock the games to play with some other people. Problem is, there are only maybe 3-4 games worth playing again.

Let me address the 2 points many have made.
1) It's funny. Yes it is...the first couple times you see it. Then it's not funny any more. It's like hearing the same joke for the 5th time, it's  not like the first time you heard it. In other words, it doesn't save the game.

2) Some games are fun. Yes, maybe 3-4 of them. Only 2-3 would I play in multiplayer more than once...the bunny hunt, dancing, and the warthog racing. We played each of the others once or twice, laughed a little, but then everyone says, ""What other games does it have?"" i.e. I'm bored with that now.

Even the best games got old very quickly though. Bunny Hunt is too easy and we were ready to be done with it after playing it for an hour...and it is exactly the same every time, no variation or AI at all. Warthog racing is cute the first couple times, but leaves you thinking, ""Is that it?"" The dancing game is quite a bit of fun in multiplayer but is not worth the $50 price tag on its own. The ice sliding game similar to curling is an ok game too.

The games are clever in that they do think of interesting ways to use the Wiimote. However, I think too much thought went into thinking of clever ways to use it rather than thinking about how fun each game would actually be. There is almost no replay value whatsoever.

Bottom line: I have had the game 3 days now, have beaten it (which is unusual for me), and am bored with it. I am wishing I could trade it back in for Super Monkey Ball now, but I know the store will give me nothing for it.

I give it 3 stars overall because there are some good qualities and I did have some fun playing it the first day. I would recommend renting it before you buy it though because you'll be wishing you had the $50 back after playing it for a few days. You'll be thumbing through the menus wondering ""Is that it?"" and ""Have I missed something?"".

Speaking as someone who didn't play this alleged original, I was surprised by this game.  It feels like it was trying to be the original Atelier Iris game, as far as presentation, but then it has very questionable design decisions.  Like the fact you have to spend points to execute a combo - really?  The guy can't just ""know"" to swing his sword again after doing it the first time?

Also, the sprites don't react when they're near death.  On two occasions the characters were down to like 100 HP and I didn't know it until battle end when I went to check armor.  I mean at least have them lean over, say they're almost done for, do SOMETHING.

The UI is too spread apart.  When you're playing on a large monitor it's not friendly to have one  tiny gauge in every corner.

I also was not a fan of the controls beyond basic attacking.  Pressing L2 to dash - why does that make sense?  Why not just use L3 or something?  You're already pressing the stick.

Start of the game, you're thrown right into the action with a very limited back story.  You eventually meet characters, and I'll be honest - the dialogue is quite humorous (""he's about to force himself on me...""), but otherwise it's a very limited experience overall.

I did like some of the cutscenes, the graphics were decent and the otherwise flow of combat is okay.  It just doesn't feel like it's worth full price.

This one promised great things and the graphics are beautiful. On my machine they look like photographs. The fighting was fun for a little while but I found that it gets boring quickly and is so hard to control, Indy is always whacking away at a blank wall because the guy skidded sideways during the battle - see note below about the controls.
Whats fun is its Indy! I'm only part way through it so I don't know the whole storyline yet but its good enough to keep you going.
Whats not so fun are the save games. For some unknown reason LucasArts decided that they knew when you wanted to save better than you did and only let you save at stage end, I have replayed and replayed level after level to the point where I'm sick of some of them. I'm not one of those players that can manipulate all the key combinations with ease (there are 24 key combinations and most keys do different things depending on whats going on at the time) I'm also not very good at memorizing mortal-combat style fight combos so having to try and hit LMB+RMB (Left Mouse Button, Right Mouse Button) then anouther LMB+RMB then the ""W"" (4 mouse buttones and a keystroke) to make an attack leaves me helplessly trying to find the W key while Indy stands there and gets shot in the back. If your a fan of this style of fighting then this game is for you because there is a LOT of it.
The music isn't what I had hoped, I wanted lots of swelling ""Indy"" themes when I did something good, but its mostly non-existant.
I found the controls the worst part of the game, they are so non-intuitive that even now I hate them, I'm sorry but if I had known the controls would be like this I would not have bought the game - download the demo and try for yourself! The controls direct Indy in relation to the screen and not Indy, so if Indy is pointing left and you hit the forward arrow he doesn't go forward he instantly turns right and runs away from you, if he is pointing left and you push left, he doesn't turn left he moves towards the left of the screen (forward to him), actually its not directly left as he moves in a big circle while pointing left.
Apparently Indy has been to swimming class as well, for when he is underwater he moves at about 50 miles per hour. He can swim the whole length of levels and back bouncing off walls while underwater.

Give it a go, but don't buy it. It isn't worth buying. I also found the controls horrendous. This is the first PS2 game I have played since purchasing my own PS2 console yesterday afternoon. I hope maneuvers are easier in other games.
Overall, a cute game, an OK game, with a pale humour. But what age range would love this game?That's a hard one. There is not enough to it to be adored by grown ups or teens. Yet the controls in this game take some getting used to, so I'm not sure if it would be children. Not small children.
Maybe kids around the age of 10 would really enjoy it.

3.0,False,"11 14, 2015",ACKE7RAMWLVP7,B00VU4J8YY,Brandon,"When I first heard about the new Call of Duty, I was not really surprised because it was going to more of futuristic warfare just like Advanced Warfare. I thought it would be World at War 2 but then I realized that the developers had to change some stuff with the Zombie story mode. They should have made the next sequel after World at War and before Black Ops. To be honest, I bought this game just for zombies and some online multiplayer. The single campaign mode seemed odd but not that bad at all. I only did a few missions because I got quickly bored with the online modes. I was surprised that one of my fav actors is starred in the video game which was Detective Stabler, Christopher Meloni and glad that he is involved with the franchise of COD. Pretty much any type of known actors/actress can be a part of the video game industry just by voice acting and grabbing his/her image and put inside of a video game. But other than that, the campaign mode is good.

Furthermore with gameplay, I did not feel that black ops gameplay that I had from Black Ops 2. It seemed really different. I was quite disappointed that something changed in that certain element of the game. The way you run or sprint seemed odd or the way you aim at your opponents or getting killed too quickly. It is really tough to explain to compare this with BO2. In my opinion, I think that BO2 was better than this. These developers tried too much with BO3 like they are trying to become better than AW's content. Yes, I say that BO3 is better than AW because better gameplay and awesome explosion sounds but comparing this with the previous versions, I have to say that BO2 was better. We have to leave this futuristic warfare behind us and go back to Modern Era or back in time during the World at War. More fans rather have that than jumping off from walls, controlling drones, becoming a super human, or unknown weapons that are being created. No matter what, I will keep buying every year's new COD game because I am fanboy but might have different perspectives before, during or after playing the game. I assume too much about these new upcoming games, thinking that these will be games of the year, then soon or later, you will realize that some of the previous versions Cod like BO2, COD MW1 & 2, and World at War were actually the best of all time in the COD series. Hopefully, they will be remastered for the new gen consoles. I am tired of these new COD games. I do agree with most people that COD is dead now. I wanted to have that awesome experience from the past games. I just cannot get that in these new releases.

Zombies will be my best favorite mode ever! It was funny that the fanboys wanted Infinity Ward to create zombies after World at War release but we should have know that Treyarch was best at it. This new map with new characters with awesome weapons are quite fascinating but the zombies got extremely hard. By round 5-6, they come at you at different directions. I remember when Treyarch made the zombies come out in certain barricades but when you play this, FORGET IT! They come out in different directions. It is crazy, tougher, and exciting at the same time. I think they wanted us to die quicker than trying to survive until round 30 or more. I am guessing that they also made the easter egg easier to find items and continue unlocking stories of each characters which is great. Now, we don't really have to search online to find out how to do the easter egg. It should be self explanatory in the game because the narrator or some kind of ghost tells you what to do like, ""you must explore the unexplored."" It was your job to figure it out unless you can just research it online. Overall, it is great but tough, The map is big, different looks of the zombie mode gameplay, and more scarier bosses like some kind of giant plant monster that they stole from Plants vs. Zombies XD. A new feature in the zombie mode was gaining more exp for certain guns you used. So I am guessing that they wanted all of us to keep playing zombies so we can gain levels and increase our advantages with the weapons that we use all the time and when these zombies become more tougher, we won't have any problems.

Overall, the game is not that bad. I bought it digitally than the hard copy. I kind of regret it because what happens if I wanted to return the game? :( Too late for that lol. The things they need to improve on are the servers, the gameplay bugs, and lower down of getting killed to quickly (even though it is not hardcore mode -_-). The servers are terrible in zombies especially. Somehow, I joined in a game lobby with 10 people like how is that possible lol of course, if this happens to you, quickly back out and find match again. You might have to do that for at least a couple of times because the servers cannot get you into a good quality match which it disappoints me big time.", BO3,1447459200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3.0,False,"01 3, 2016",AZKB5T3T2LTE8,B00BRA9R5G,Outrun1986,"There are 2 versions of this controller, one version has a built in rechargable lithium battery, and rumble features. The second version takes AA batteries and does not have any rumble. The second version is the newer version and is the one you most likely will get.

Now there are pros and cons to each version. While the first version has a built in battery, from my experience these built in batteries usually die after a few months, especially when made by a third party which this is. This will leave you with a dead battery, no way to replace it and you will have to plug your controller in with a USB cable in order to use it, leaving you with a controller that will always be wired.

The AA battery version also has its cons, it seems to munch AA batteries pretty good, which means you will be replacing them often just to play your games, if you are out of battery no more games for you or if the batteries die in the middle of a game you will have to replace them and that could become a problem. Now if you own a set of AA rechargable batteries that you can use with this controller its a no brainer to get this version. But if you are looking to save money on a controller for the Wii U and you don't already have rechargable batteries you will have to pay for those, making the cost of this controller closer to that of the official Nintendo controller and probably not worth it. if you don't have rechargables already, then you will have to spend money constantly for AA batteries, which means this controller is not worth it next to the official Nintendo pro controller. This version also does not have rumble, so if you can live without it, and have a set of rechargable batteries on hand then go for it.

My 3 star rating comes from the actual performance of this controller. This controller has HUGE dead zones. This means that when you push the analog stick you have to push it over all the way to the side in order to get movement out of it. Other controllers you only have to push a little bit on the analog to get movement out of the joystick. This could become very problematic with some games. If you are purchasing this for FPS play like Call of Duty I would recommend against it.

Does this controller work for me, yes it does, but that doesn't mean it will work for everyone. I have rechargable batteries and do not desire rumble in my controllers, plus I only play casual type single player games, so yes it works for me.

For most people I would recommend springing for the few extra dollars and purchasing the official Nintendo Pro Controller. The pro controller has a built in battery and boasts an 80 hour battery life which is enough to completely play through 2 40 hour games. Considering that this controller is only $10 or so cheaper than the Nintendo brand I would recommend against it simply because it will easily cost you $10 in alkaline battery costs or rechargable battery costs alone and the Nintendo controller comes with a very strong battery inside of it. Its unlikely you will have issues with the Nintendo battery as I have never had a Nintendo battery die on me even though I have some devices with batteries in them that are pretty old, they still charge and hold a charge reasonably well. You simply cannot argue with an 80 hour battery life.",Be aware that there are 2 versions of this controller before buying,1451779200,,,

First of all, the track pad circles are way too slippery (It feels like the circles are coated with a waxy substance) with no texture on them; in addition, I would suggest creating some sort of texture to stop ones hand from slipping off the pads. Valve had removed this on a later version, the idea why is unknown. In addition, if you clench the controller too tight because what is happening on screen is intense you will likely press the paddle on the back breaking the immersion of the game one is playing. Secondly it is awkward to control your character with the little joystick I would suggest placing the joystick closer the thumb by switching the placement of the circle pad and joy stick. The whole controller is smaller than a traditional game pad; for example, the face buttons are shifted to the left slightly (So when you wanna press A you press B and vise versa).

3.0,False,"11 25, 2015",A3ULPB81JD4OGA,B00002ST2J,Kelly Groce,"This is actually a pretty nice version of MK2 for a portable console.  The play control is responsive and fun.  There is none of the slowdown lag of the first MK Gameboy game.  Each character is able to do a fatality.  The game has a nice variety of characters and is quick and fun to play.  The game could have been a great portable fighting game if only the developers would have fixed the following 3 things.

The 1st is the lack of the sub boss Kintaro, who is is not in this game.  What a bummer battling Kintaro in the arcades and on the SNES is what really makes the game so much fun not Shoa Kahn.  The previous Gameboy game MK1  was able to put Goro in the game why didn't they just delay the release and spend some more time to add Kintaro in the game.  It could have paid a lot of dividends by boosting sales if they had been able to make it work.

The 2nd big issue with the game is the lack of stage variety.  There is only 2 stage backgrounds and 1 hidden one Goro's lair.  So you end up looking at the same backgrounds over and over making you bored of the game.  The previous GB game had 3 backgrounds and you really notice the difference when you play this game.

The 3rd and final issue is lack of any endings for the game.  Again this goes back to lack of effort on the game developers.  They could have at least put in simple text of what happens when each character wins the tournament.  MK1 for Gameboy did not do this either.  Besides the boring old Congratulations and credits nothing to excite you are give you a reason to keep plying the game through with each character.  It really hurts the replay value in the end.

Overall it is a nice game to play for about 15 to 20 minutes when you are out and about but easily forgettable.  I would rate it 3 1/2 stars if only they put Kintaro in the game I would have been so much happier.  The game was 2MB and the Gameboy was able to hold up to 4MB at the time so to me Acclaim kind of shortchanged the product.  They could have put in the Sewer stage or Tree Stage that would not take up that much more memory and would have made a huge difference in the game.

3.0,True,"03 20, 2014",A9ADORMM00ZP2,B008XHCLFO,Gryffinditz,"Firstly, this is a great grip. It fits perfectly and nearly all ports are accessible easily. I have a neurological disorder, unfortunately, which causes my right hand to be generally weaker than my right, as well as a severe reduction in fine motor skills. This grip is so much more comfortable than the 3DS alone. Without it I had been playing games in short half hour bursts, much less when I was playing MK7. With the grip now I can play even MK for over an hour without needing a break. The triggers are so much easier to use as well. They had gotten stuck a few times over several hours of playing, but that's something I'm willing to overlook, as annoying as it is. This is because due to my disorder the R button is too hard to reach on its own in the heat of the moment (like when you need to drift in MK7) and the triggers are SO much better than nothing.

So why the 3 star review? Sadly the opening for the headphone jack port does not accommodate L shaped jacks. My Sennheiser ear bud L shaped jack barely fits, and it often comes loose. The jack for my over the ear headphones will not fit at all. This is a terrible inconvenience and one that makes me very sad. I'm put into the position of choosing between using headphones OR the grip with ear buds that work sometimes. I'd probably be able to find a cord with a straight jack for my headphones, but that's annoyingly inconvenient and it doesn't solve the ear bud issue. When you look at the port hole, you can see the problem would have been solved if the material above the port would have been cut out. Did DreamGEAR not do their research? Would it have cost too much money to accommodate the port like that? I'm not sure. What I do know is that now when I'm at the library, I can't use the grip, or I can't listen to the beauty of the Bravely Default soundtrack. Potential buyers, make sure you evaluate your headphone jacks and how important headphones are to you. But since there are so few options for controller grips, it might not matter.

3.0,False,"04 4, 2013",A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B005THAX6K,Jeff Johnson,"Plenty of people bought this game sight unseen, because its Aliens and its from Gearbox which made the hit game Borderlands. Plus the screenshots and videos looked really awesome. Well the great looking media is a lie. The reality is that this is a game that has been in development since 2006 and the actual in game graphics show that this was probably meant for Playstation 2. The cut scenes look terrible and low resolution.

With that being said, this is a sequel that is designed to fit between Aliens and Alien 3. This creates giant plot holes like why are they back at the Aliens planet and how the nuclear explosion didn't destroy everything. Or how a key character from the Aliens film got back. Not that I'm spoiling anything, you'll know it really quick. Major questions aren't answered, but I have a feeling they'll all be answered in the $30 DLC.

I did like the game for the 3 days that I played it, even if it was easy. The weapons have no punch or impact. Plus the weapons were designed for multiplayer with accuracy stats so you have a 70% chance of hitting them depending on the weapon. Even in single player. You can do the single player campaign cooperatively, but the extra players don't take pre existing roles they're just added into the game which just makes an easy game even easier.

There are trophies galore. Glitches galore. Clipping glitches like being able to throw a face hugger off you through a wall. Closing doors on NPCs to see them half in and half out of the door. The final boss you can clip through. Having my NPC friend run in slow motion... hilarious. I reload my weapon as I'm cutting the door so it goes into the ammor reload animation and the timer for the door cutting. Then goes into the door cutting.

After the first few hours, there is a great stealth level where you are gunless and forced to creep through an alien's den undetected. That level offers the most tense gameplay that would be similar to Alien 1. I really feel like you should have been less overpowered in this game. You feel like Hercules vs a kitten farm, because there is near limitless ammo and plenty of armor. You get regenerating health in brackets, which some would complain about, but its fine. The non human enemies barely hit you. They just jump out and straight into your gun fire. They either appear in front or behind you. Never from the side or the ceiling or the floor like they do in the movies.

If I don't not insta killing everyone I can see the enemy AI does have intelligence, which is strange, because it sure didn't playing the PC version. While the aliens are no threat at all, the human soldiers are a bigger threat, but pretty clueless when you flank them, but I guess that's a problem in most games. Friendly AI ends up shooting at walls thinking they can shoot through them. Another hilarious glitch is that 3 aliens will all jump to the exact same spot all at once and take up the same space directly in front of you.

The final and biggest glaring issue that I have is that to complete the story you need to buy $30 DLC that may or may not ever get finished. But you can buy it. That is the biggest insult of the game to anyone that spent $60 on this game is knowing they have to pay an extra $30 to finish it. My feeling would be different if I thought OMG that was a great game and I'm gonna play it again and again until the DLC comes out! Gearbox could have still done DLC to further the story. Maybe I'd be less angry with the ending if they had the ending after the final boss lead into the DLC. Kind of like the end would be the beginning of the DLC and not end the game. On top of that.... I have a feeling the game is so easy, because they want that $30 from you and the DLC will be more difficult.

With all of this being said, I felt Aliens vs Predator 2010 was a better game with a better story, with better graphics and lighting, with better multiplayer. Take that for what it's worth.

I was hesitant to own it because I am a little old for hardcore games that everyone praises for their difficulty, but I was persuaded to try it because of fond memories of a wonderfully difficult combat RPG called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Severance-Blade-Of-Darkness/dp/B00066D60E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Severance Blade Of Darkness</a>.  Unable to find a rental I bought it. Sadly, I think this game does not measure up to the reviews.

My review in brief: -1 one star for the grinding because of the few and far between saves (difficulty itself is ok), - 1/2 star for miscellaneous stuff, -1/2 a star for simplistic combat mechanics.

So, let me throw some water on the glowing reviews.

The game is very difficult.  I think the difficulty is the heart of why people love this game.  The difficulty gives a genuine sense of accomplishment when you succeed in getting past a certain point, and this is truly rewarding in a way most games are not.  The difficulty, however is greatly compounded not by interesting challenges but by tedium.  Much of the game becomes tedium because if you die you need to repeat everything.  Were you really excited by defeating that tough group of monsters - well awesome!  If you die to a new monster a few steps down you have to fight them all again.  And again.  And again.  This is where the game completely falls down.  The difficulty is truly rewarding, but the necessity of repeating so much of the game if you fail is lame.  I love the difficulty, I enjoy the tenseness of being hyper aware and cautious - all plusses.  But they overdid it on with the repetition.  It quickly devolves into grinding, but grinding with often no reward (losing souls).  If the difficulty were the only problem with the game, I would give it 4 stars.  I should mention I started the game with the barbarian and was about to throw the game away after an hour, but started a priest and suddenly felt like I was on god-mode, so choosing your class is very important.

The difficulty is not the only problem in this game.  There is no one thing that detracts from the overall game, but a bunch of random stuff that adds up to reduce the game by another star.  This laundry list includes things such as the poor information given about items.  It is not easy to understand the properties of the weapons.  The story is simplistic and linear.  The graphics, with the exception of the demons, are bland.  Yeah - they are a little ""glowey"", but bland.  The major demons are usually awesome.  You can only have 4 characters.  I would take away 2 stars just for that.  That is a quick way for the developer to say to the gamer - I hate you.  Such pointless limitations are always a huge turnoff for me.  There is a bunch of world-tendency stuff that you need to be aware of in order to get certain outcomes that you will eventually need to grind through on another play through if you want.  This is not really clearly explained anywhere in the game...at all.  Or if it is I have not seen it.  You cannot sell anything - so why are there junk drops?  The online stuff is ok, but apparently did not grab me as much as it has many others.  In many ways it seems the makers wanted the game to be inaccessible in the way information is presented within the game.

Finally, I would almost take a final point off for the combat.  It's the point of the entire game, and in the end it is fairly weak.  Now, let me be careful how I put this.  The combat is technically pretty good.  Different weapons are different with different ranges, speeds, etc (getting the short spear was like a revelation for fighting the bastard-sword wielding knights).  The blocking is well done, the dodging is well done.  The autolock is a weakness, but not a terrible one.  The stamina creates some strategy.  The combat is tense because of what I said above, but if the game had an ""easy"" mode it would become the most boring game ever.  There is no advancement in combat through the game.  If someone knows about some advancement please correct me, but if you choose a straight melee player you will be doing the exact same move (attack, dodge, repeat) with the first monster as you will with the next to last.  The RPG aspect is not even necessary - they could auto-level you and you would never notice.  Other classes have miracles and spells, and I recommend making that part of any character, but the melee aspect is ultimately simplistic.  Now, I referenced a game above that I previously played and that game was harder because in order to excel you had to master complicated attacks.  If you finished the game using the same attacks as you started with you were toast.  That made the game much more engaging and difficult to master.  It was more rewarding when near death, without a potion, against tough foes you pulled off the great new move you had just learned and been practicing and finished them.  If you master patience, you have mastered demon souls.  I read a comment on another review where someone who struggled with the difficulty said if there was an easy mode it would be game of the year.  I strongly disagree, I wish there were more frequent save points, but if there were an easy mode this game would be forgettable because the combat is so lackluster.

This is a game for fans of the genre, but probably not anyone else.  The tenseness is sometimes lost in the tedium, the combat is simplistic, and the game has too many minor annoyances.  I still like it, I just can not love it.","Tense gameplay makes for memories, but dragged down by other problems",1257033600,16,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

3.0,False,"10 15, 2016",A33Y35HJGDHZ2H,B01DE9DY8S,commorancy,"First and foremost, the full 3D virtual reality presented in this VR headset is entirely compelling. It truly is. Meaning, the environments are amazingly immersive. So immersive, in fact, that you might find yourself attempting to lean against a virtual wall (and falling over in the process). Be careful when playing as you can easily be tricked into believing a wall or an object has substance. Also, objects feel mostly true to life size when in the headset. The Batmobile looks amazing. The interactivity in the environments is uncanny. This is a good thing. Even when you find yourself at the flat 2d interface of the PlayStation menu system, it's still immersive because the screen floats like a huge movie theater screen in front of you that feels like IMAX. It's a very compelling experience. Unfortunately, there are also drawbacks to this headset that degrade the experience. Mind you, this is a long review.

If you are all TL;DR, please skip to that section at the bottom.

Display technology... This is the primary design problem with this device. While the environments are fully immersive offering 360 spherical view angles (including moving around in the environment in limited ways), that immersion is tainted by the visible pixel grid. Once you see it, you can't stop seeing it. It's like looking into the environment through a pair of fishnet covered glasses.

While Sony didn't use a standard square matrix LCD screen and instead chose an offset style pixel grid, that's of little concession to exactly how few pixels there are and exactly how many there really need to be to make a VR environment become crystal clear. This technology also screams loudly at needing OLED technology as the base. Why? While standard LCDs show light through the pixel grid (which is extremely obvious on pitch black scenes), OLED offers 100% inky black blackness. A VR headset absolutely needs this to remain immersive. Also, OLED would give rich inky blackness to black objects like Batman's suit, to shadows and to all other things that need it. OLED also offers rich saturated color, which a VR gaming environment also needs. I feel that Sony made a compromise here and shouldn't have.

Audio... This headset needs a way to provide virtual 7.1 audio built in. Offering a cheap pair of earbuds is like handing you dollar store window cup holders to put into your Bentley. I also found that the loudest volume from the control panel hooked to the headset is not that loud. Sure, it doesn't need to be blast-your-eardrums loud, but it could a be a bit louder.

Ventilation... the PSVR desperately needs a ventilation system. This thing is hot to wear. Not only do you have to wear it tight, there is no airflow around your face. Coupled with the fact that the cushion pieces are rubber, you start sweating immediately. This heat issue becomes a problem for another reason. The magnifying eyepieces that focus the screen start fogging up and, of course, ruin the experience. You have to periodically stop and wipe them down or take it off. Thankfully, Sony provides a cloth. Note, I'd be remiss in not stating that the rubber used here is quite thin and is likely not of archival quality. I might expect this rubberized material to begin breaking down in 8-10 years... not that you'll be playing this PSVR then.

Lenses... the magnifying eye pieces are definitely not Carl Zeiss quality. It takes ages to finally finagle the unit into not only a comfortable position, but one that actually focuses the screen properly. Unfortunately, I never was able to get 100% clarity when looking to the far left or far right. These lenses just have too much aberration and distortion for that. It definitely needs better lenses.

Camera position... This is a PITA. Just about the time you get the headset comfortable, you realize the camera is in the wrong position. Now you have to take off the headset, fiddle with the camera and put it back on. I don't know how many times I went through this process while attempting to play Arkham VR. Ultimately, I found that the calibration of this game is primarily a problem with the game, but is compounded by the camera position. I will post a review of Arkham VR separately and all of the calibration issues I ran into with that game.

Adjusting the headset... This is also a PITA. Let's just say that you should expect to put it on and take it off no less than 20-30 times the first game that you play. Not only will you need to fiddle with getting the unit just in the right spot, you also need to get the camera in the right spot in relation to the headset. Headset positioned too low and it's all out of focus, too high and you can't see the screen. Headset screen too far away and it's out of focus, too close and it's cutting off your circulation. Getting a comfortable fit and bringing the screen into focus takes a while of fiddly adjustments.

Content resolution... I know that I talked about the screen resolution above, but this section is somewhat different.. I knew that going into the PSVR that it has a 1080p screen, but the games don't really play in 1080p in the way that you think. Yes, the screen is fully used to render the environment. However, the environment is scaled down and out so the pixels of the content are blatantly obvious. Meaning, the headset operates like showing 320p video on a 1080p screen. The resolution of the content is just too low and the pixels are entirely obvious. I'm guessing that that is in part due to the processor power of the PS4, but this kind of technology screams for a high res OLED screens.

Calibration... Expect to go into the calibration settings often to recalibrate. I find that the headset loses its calibration very easily. I believe this may be in part due to the head tracking used. While the camera does an okay job at this, this technology feels like it needs at least two more head tracking devices to be a whole lot more accurate. I found that when playing Arkham VR, not only would the headset lose its place, I'd have to kill the game and restart just to get back on track. Note that Arkham VR has its own calibration system which is separate from the PS4's setup. So, expect to calibrate separately for some games.

Headset itself... Fitting the headset to your head can be challenge. The headset has 3 basic touch points. Up and down, In and out around the head and in and out for the screen. These are the adjustable pieces. Once you have the unit on your head, you can tighten the around the head piece by cranking a little wheel on the back. You may need to do this to bring the screen into focus. Instead, I believe the headset needed a lot more adjustment points. Specifically, the screen piece. This piece needed not only in and out, but up and down and rotation. The lenses also needed rotating wheels to help focus them better (and individually per eye). Unfortunately, this headset design, while simplistic, leaves a bit to be desired for adjustments. It's good, but it's not great.

Head tracking... While this piece is performed, more or less by the camera, it could do with more work. I find that the camera seems to lose sync with the headset quickly. So, you're constantly needing to readjust where the screen is in the headset. For example, I would look straight toward my camera and reset my screen to float in that spot. After using the headset for a while, I found the screen had floated to the right. Meaning, I had to now turn my head to the right to see the screen that was formerly in front. You can reset the placement by pressing the OPTIONS button for a few seconds, but I would have expected a little more longevity from the calibration than 5-10 minutes.

Setup... It takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Basically, the headset attaches to a small processor unit. The processor unit has 5 device connections: a USB connection, an HDMI in (from PS4), and HDMI out (to TV), the headset (two cables) and a power cord with a power brick. Yes, you'll need to find a place to plug yet another power supply in. I feel that Sony should have built all of these connectors into the PS4 Pro and released the headset along side with the PS4 Pro so you only need one connection from the headset to the PS4. This would have done two things. Encouraged people to upgrade to the Pro and not need this processor unit thing that takes up yet more space and a power plug. Also, because the processor consumes one of the USB ports and the camera consumes another, that means there's only one USB port left for anything else you might need.

Build quality... Sony used to be known for its innovation, design, style and build quality. For the $399 price point, it seems far too many compromises were made to deliver this headset in its first incarnation. I'm certain Sony can fix many of the problems inherent in this 1.0 version. It's just that it's odd from a company like Sony that used to be known to figure this stuff out the first time. Not quite sure what happened to Sony's design team with this product.

At a time when our tablets and TV screens are becoming 4K (and eventually 10K displays), the Playstation VR suffers horribly from feeling like an N64 console resolution in a sea of 4K displays. It's basically a fish out of water. If I could get a 4K OLED display in a headset like this... and if the headset could display full 1080p content on that 4K display, that's what would feel realistic and modern. A VR headset definitely needs retina pixel density so you just don't see them. Instead, we get 320p video displayed on a 1080p screen. It feels outdated even though it's brand new.

While I do realize that Sony will smooth out some of the software and calibration problems in time, what can't be overcome are the hardware and design limitations. That will take a brand new hardware iteration to fix.

TL;DR... What's the reason for 3 stars then? One star is removed for the near constant need to adjust the headset, the continual loss of tracking and the lack of adjustment points on the headset. A second star is removed for the low pixel density used to drive the display, which is quite apparent when you play, which prevents the environments from being crystal clear in combination with visible shiny pixels when a scene fades to black. I applaud Sony for its efforts in producing this VR headset as the technology idea is compelling. However, for its $399-$499 price point (depending on bundle) combined with its current lack of games, you'll want to understand what you are getting buying it now. If it were half the price, I would have given it a slightly higher rating.",Needed better design and more games,1476489600,2,,

While the game is great, the Singstore is far from impressive, especially when it comes to North American artists.  Sony has been lethargic with regard to adding songs from the back catalog (there are a number of more popular songs in the PS3 discs), and the selection is much smaller than that of other regions like the UK.

What makes this more frustrating is that Sony, already a few years in the PS3's life, is still making PS2 discs with new content, while the PS3 version stays stagnant, which is where it suffers as a party game--since a great of the songs are unknown (like Natalia, who has 5 songs)--a lot of people don't know the words, which makes the game less fun, especially with things like pass the mic.  To make the game work at a party you need artists and songs that are more ubiquitous like Madonna or Michael Jackson, which you can get on the PS2 discs.

If the PS2 discs didn't have more popular songs I'd give this game 5 stars, but the best Sony will do is a disc-swap, where you're stuck with songs you won't want, which is the opposite of the a-la-carte selection we are getting used to.  Sony said they would update the store every two weeks, and, aside from the poor update selection (in the US), they often miss updates.  If I didn't already own the game, I wouldn't bother buying it, as the Singstore is horrid, which is unfortunate because for the songs I do like, it's a great game.

The other issue people seem to have is the wireless mic problem; while it would be nice I don't really play enough for this to be that big a deal.","Great singing game, but poor Singstore selection",1221696000,4,,

3.0,True,"12 2, 2015",A37Q7OI175WGFB,B016NZFGP4,Christian Romero,"Star Wars Battlefront is the newest reboot of the Battlefront series. Made by DICE the same people who developed the Battlefield series. Controversy has been surrounding this game with many people giving it negative reviews. While other people are enjoying the series' return after ten years. Is Star Wars Battlefront the triumphant return of the series whose last game was in 2005? Or is it a cash grab looking to capitalize on the franchise that took us to a galaxy far, far, away.

I will start by saying Star Wars Battlefront is not in anyway a bad game. I played worse games that release this year and even worse Star Wars games. People giving this game one star are over exaggerating this games issues. However there are issues with the game some deal breakers for some.

Lets start with the campaign oh wait? There is no story/campaign here what so ever. This is the biggest problem with the game. In an effort to release near the Force Awakens EA decided to ditch the campaign and go for a mostly multiplayer only. In the place of a campaign there are single player stuff. Like Battles, which is multiplayer matches, but with bots. Missions which is like a campaign except theres only five and they can be complete all within 30 minutes. To put the cherry in this lackluster single player content you get a horde mode. On the positive side of this barebones single player content it can be played split-screen. The days of couch Co-Op aren't dead looking at you Halo 5.

So with all the focus on multiplayer how does it play? With Battlefield 4 launching with broken servers. I was concerned that when I play the game the servers will be a disaster with rubber banding and connectivity issues, and to my surprise they actually work! The game plays smoothly hardly any latency issues.  The game launched with 9 modes, 10 if you count the free DLC Battle of Jakku. Only downside is its only twelve maps with a game thats multiplayer only you think being Multiplayer only. You think they will have double the maps. I mean Black Ops 3 has the same amount of maps and it had a campaign plus zombies. Another disappointment is lack of clone wars playing the original Battlefronts as a kid, the clone wars were some of my favorite maps and to see it gone is saddening. Also customization is terrible. Rebels have a choice of humans both male and female and then unlock the Alien species at a higher level. For Stormtroopers its the same with a no helmet option minus the aliens and a scout and shadow trooper armor set. A No Helmet Option with same options as the rebels, talk about cookie cutter customization.

Dont worry about the lack of maps EA has you covered! For only the price of $50 you can buy a Season Pass that gives you access to four expansions! What an incredible value!  You cant spell steal without EA. Being serious here the fact that lacking a lot compared to Battlefront 2 which released 10 years ago. Why are they overcharging for this Season Pass? On the plus side they do promise to release more free content like Jakku. Heres hoping they make up for this lack of content in the future. Just please give us space battles.

Now this game isn't all disappointment because there are a lot of good things it actually does. Like the graphics they are amazing. The frostbite engine cements itself as being one of the best looking engines out there. It absolutely captures the classic trilogy perfectly with locations like Hoth, Endor, Tatooine, and the mentioned but not shown volcanic planet of Sullust. Anyone who has seen the classic trilogy can appreciate the graphics more as you can see a lot of work was put in to faithfully recreate those scenes and put them in game. I will say its the best looking game that has been released so far for this console generation. It also runs at 60 frames per second without a dip in performance. Its truly a technical marvel and DICE should be lauded for the work they put in. During matches I would take a break from the action and soak in the environments and always being amazed by the graphics and level of detail in the maps.

Not only it captures the look of Star Wars it capture the sounds. The blaster fire sounds are as authentic as ever. John Williams original score returns with it being masterful used during certain parts. The only negative is the voice acting for the heroes its terrible. Darth Vader and Han Solo sound nothing like the original people at all, the rest of the heroes voice acting is serviceable at best. The gunplay is great the option to play first person or third person. Its fun to go shooting with your blasters and Darth Vader shows up only to have a speeder bike save you by crashing into Darth Vader and killing. Its magic moments like that that makes this game special and has me playing with a big dumb smile on my face. However if you're a competitive gamer into Esports and that entire scene this game won't do it for you. As its gear toward more fun less competition, so if you want that counter strike strategic shooter you won't find it here.

 In Conclusion Star Wars Battlefront is a fun game. Is it $60 dollars worth of fun? No. This game has too little for $60. I would recommend a buy on sale for $30 or a complete edition with all the DLC. It has its moments but Star Wars Battlefront was ultimately disappointing. When you consider a its predecessors had more content and that was back during the PS2. However there is no denying its a fun shooter. If EA can fix all the problems and add a single player campaign in a sequel or something then Battlefront will be a top shooter. Until then we have a good foundation but a weak structure.","You do have your moments.

As the other reviewers noted, this is not the classic R-Type game. It is a strategy game along the lines of the traditional hex-based wargames. I have never really played those original R-Type games anyway so I get to treat this game with a clean slate.

Pros:
- It is very addictive

- Even if you lose a battle you don't lose all your ships. So you at least reap some rewards so that you can build a stronger fleet, learn from your mistakes, and try again.

- Surprisingly when you are close to obtaining victory (while potentially losing it all) this game really does put you on the edge of your seat.

- Missions are long and bountiful (57 missions total). A mission can take at least 20 to 30 minutes to complete. By making the missions long your level of commitment and excitement grows. Even though you seem to be able to plough through your enemies you are always wondering whether the tables could be turned at any moment because the enemy may have additional fighters hiding somewhere.

- Good story that makes you feel like you are in charge of the fleet.

- Supports adhoc mode play though I haven't tried it.

Cons:

- The in-game movies are too slow to load so usually you turn them off. This is a real pity because they could have easily used the geometric representations in the main strategy screen and given this game some kind of 3-dimensional feel.

- There is no way to undo an accidental move.

- Movement of large fleets can be labor intensive since there is no way to group ships into squadrons.

4.0,False,"05 27, 2011",A3GE8NHFZ5R05X,B001O1PAMC,technical_specialist,"I played the SNES version of this game which was one of my all-time favorite.  This DS remake brings back lots of great memories on this original FE.  The SNES version back then (like 15~17 years ago) actually combined the Shadow Dragon as Ch. 1 and the other DS release (currently only available in Japanese Import version) as Ch. 2.

The DS version, although seeming took away some of the classic elements in its predecessor, is still a very well made stragegy game.

PROS:
+ Gives FE fans who entered the series midway through the luxury to have a taste in its history and how the game evolved over time.
+ Good balance between the different classes, though mages seem to play a lesser role in this version due to their extremely weak resistance to physical attack  (in other releases it wasn't as difficult to beef up your mages' defense, but in this one it's almost impossible to get their D in double digits even by means of S/L.  FE fans know what I am talking about).  Well, this makes sense afterall.
+ Sound is good
+ Hidden stages
+ Enemies have a much fair chance of hitting in this release.  Unlike all previous releases in which ordinary enemy units have an average hit % of like 30~40%.

CONS:
- No cut-scenes
- You basically can't keep extra recruits.  FE fans have the tendency to ""collect"" as many recruits as possible by avoiding having them defeated in battles.  Well in order to access the hidden stages you will have to sacrafice basically all but your main force.  I mean at the end you gotta keep it down to like 12 or 13 people in order to get to the very last hidden stage right before the finale.
- No class-change for Mars is a disappointment.  Although this was how the original was, it'd be nice to see your main char transform at least once throughout the game, especially considering the length of this game (it could easily take 20~30+ hours).
- System a little too simple for a 2010 remake.  Basically the only commands are either to attack or to heal.  They could've easily tossed in class-specific abilities as an incentive to develop weaker classes.

Now we can create videos using the PS Eye and then post them online. It is also great fun to be able to watch the myriad of videos available from other users, which range from talented to crazy over the top. There is one big problem with the online capabilities though, and that is the reason why, even though the game is great, it gets only four stars: you cannot compete against others online! The other minor issue has to do with the limited length of the videos as well as the limited amount each player can create.

This is definitely a party game, and it is clear that the creators recognized this and provided a much wider range of battle modes. And the music is more varied in styles than before, catering to almost all tastes; by the way, I am not including the song list in this review because it is shown under the product description.

It is fun, like the DS version but is somewhat repetitious, but I think that's what makes it fun. It predictable and mindless and great for passing the time having fun.

The object of the game is to color Blob's world. Blob does that by jumping on color inks and then using that ink to touch other things, buildings, billboards, citizens called Graydians and all other objects within their world. Blob rolls and jumps and as he colors his world, a kind f fusion funk jazz plays and changes depending on the color being used.

The levels are timed but you can earn extra time by completing tasks and freeing Graydians from their dull, colorless buildings. The controls in this version are a little awkward and there is no way to save the game in the middle of a level. But it is pure fun, albeit somewhat repetitious.

Despite being my first mechanical keyboard, I really wanted one with linear switches after typing on a coworker's and I also wanted one with RGB backlighting and one of good quality. I decided this looked like the best bang for the buck. It may be overkill for me since I use it at work as a software engineer rather than at home for gaming, but it feels really good to type on. I love the lack of resistance and I can tell it is made very well.

(See update regarding the following complaints.)

I only have two complaints. The wrist rest that came with it is terrible. It is way too low and I basically don't use it. The software also leaves a lot to be desired. The effects it offers are cool, but I wish it offered a little more customization. For instance, I'd love to combine the ""rainbow wave"" effect with the ""type lighting"" effect; what I picture is that when a key is pressed, it lights up white for a couple of seconds and gradually fades back to the rainbow effect. Unfortunately, the options per effect are fairly limited.

Although the software leaves something to be desired, that is not the primary reason I gave it four stars. The primary reason for giving it four stars is the wrist rest. I fee like they could include one that does not taper so much (to the point of being pointless to use) for the price.

Despite that, I love the keyboard and will be purchasing another one for my PC at home when I get a little extra cash to spend.

UPDATE: It turns out you can use more than one effect at the same time! I figured out how to have the white type lighting effect (on key press) on top of the always-on rainbow wave. It took some messing around with it to figure out it, though, and it only works with the effects in a certain order. So, while versatile, the software is still a little difficult to use.

I still don't feel like I am ""5 stars"" in love with it, but I stand by my final verdict: the keyboard is great and I will be purchasing another one.","Sturdy build, relaxing performance; lackluster software and wrist rest",1516579200,3,"{'Color:': ' RGB', 'Style:': ' Keyboard'}",

The battle system is excellent: there are tons of different moves that you can manifest through different positioning and button combinations. The problem: technology. They haven't paid enough attention graphics, optimization, and control.
In-game, the graphics are sub-par ate best. This problem has less to do with the engine than it does with design. The levels, models, and textures just aren't that creative. In fact, everything but the well-crafted main character models is pretty flat and unoriginal.
They don't seem to have worried much about optimization. I'm running the game at 800x600 (GeForce Ti4200) and lagging when I have to fight more than 4 enemies. I've ran games with phenomenally better graphics (Enclave, Splinter Cell) at full speed with no sluggishness on 1600x1200 resolution.
I admire the rich battle system, but it is the only aspect of the game with solid controls. Movement in general is horrible; it feels like I'm running on fly-paper. Forget about any skillful dodging or even maneuvering if you aren't in Focus mode. Don't even get me started on the driving gameplay. After playing through the incredible hand-to-hand combat, entering the driving levels left me speechless. They have all the quality of a shareware Driver clone (and a bad one at that).
I don't think my review would have been so harsh if the game didn't bear the heavy namesake and had not been developed by Shiny, a development team who I know is capable of creating technologically solid games.

4.0,True,"07 8, 2009",AH0ACA7SUT8AM,B00104KJ2E,Deepak Oprah,"People have been clamoring for a sequel to Chrono Trigger for years now.  Some gamers consider Chrono Cross to be a superb sequel to that time-traveling epic, while others found it to be a dud.  I thought Chrono Cross was an excellent RPG, but I had always desired another 16-bit RPG that had the same impact on me as Chrono Trigger.  That game of 1995 managed to amaze a young 5th grader like me, because many of the game's concepts were so fresh.  For one, there weren't countless random battles.  Chrono did away with such an archaic system, and instead, instituted a fast-paced battle system involving three characters and enemies you could see on-screen before you engaged in battle.  Skirmishes were quick, you could combine moves, and you rarely had to level.  Chrono also featured amazing artwork and more proportionate characters than previous RPGs.  Besides this, it had a fresh time-traveling quest spanning multiple eras and featured many possible player-affected outcomes.  The music was also quite memorable, so overall, it was a well-rounded package.

Fast-forward fourteen years and multiple console generations later--we now have a new RPG called, Black Sigil: Blade of the Exiled, that is modeled after classics like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI.  Studio Archcraft, the Canadian developer who was responsible for the game, spent four long years working on this 16-bit-style RPG that originally began as a GBA project, but ultimately ended up on the DS.  After spending nearly 40 hours with the game, I've decided to judge Black Sigil on its own merits rather than simply comparing it to its 16-bit brethren.  Read on to find out if this RPG modeled after the classics is worth your time, or if it's as crusty as those dishes you left in the sink for over a month.

When I first powered on Black Sigil, I was greeted to a beautiful intro.  It wasn't tranquil like Chrono's Millennial Fair or action-packed like the imperial entrance into Narshe in FFVI, but the game clearly had a foreboding atmosphere.  You begin the adventure as Kairu, who is an orphan born into a magical kingdom called, Bel Lenora. Even though he was raised by a powerful duke who was commander of the army, Kairu lived a lonely existence due to people's prejudice and fear of those who lacked the ability to use magic.  A powerful swordsman named Vai who also lacked magic had previously threatened the kingdom, so their fear wasn't completely unfounded, even though it was fairly irrational.  Kairu isn't a silent hero like Crono, but is fairly likeable due to his mostly serious and sometimes humorous nature.  Early on, he is accompanied by the spunky Aurora who is the duke's daughter.  I know.  You're probably thinking she sounds like Marle, right?  Well, even with her appearance out of the picture, she's quite different due to her use of sarcasm, and her being somewhat of a romantic instead of being a rebellious tomboy with a case of the giggles.

Kairu and Aurora were quite likeable, but I also grew attached to the game's many other characters.  There's a mysterious character who wields powerful dark magic that is somewhat of a ladies' man,  a nomadic, but kind-hearted character that will remind you of Gau, a female scout who has the ability to use magic, but has a tragic past, and an adventurer that feels like a hybrid of Setzer and FFIV's Cid.  These six blokes are all great characters with a variety of abilities, but they're also accompanied by two secret characters, who I won't reveal.  They're fairly difficult to find, as you have to accomplish quite a few tasks outside of the main storyline, but they're both valuable assets to your party, like Magus was in Chrono.

So, Black Sigil has excellent character artwork and a crew full of wonderful personalities, but how is the storyline?  It isn't as groundbreaking as Chrono Trigger's, but it's an epic tale that holds its own against many games of today.  In the previous paragraph, I mentioned the magical land of Bel Lenora, and the extreme prejudice Kairu faced, but I failed to mention the aftermath.  I don't want to spoil much of the story, but as the title implies, one of your characters is exiled, and you eventually find yourself in a new land that is seemingly devoid of magic.  This land, called Artania, is home to several continents that appear to have no relation to Bel Lenora.  There are several kingdoms throughout Artania that are clearly inspired by historical kingdoms in Asia and Byzantium, and they seem to have co-existed peacefully for the most part.  The empire of Sammarkand was on the ascendance however, and had begun conquering various kingdoms through military force and the use of airships.  People who've played FFIV and FFVI have seen some of these themes before, but there is quite a bit underneath the surface that I'd rather not spoil.  Slavery and issues of prejudice are prevalent themes throughout the game--which makes Black Sigil much more serious than most games of the 16-bit era.

The storyline, art, and characters are all excellent even in 2009 (an era in which our world should be in ruin according to Chrono Trigger), but how is the gameplay?  Well, it's a mixed bag.  The creators of Black Sigil implemented some original ideas into the battle system, but unfortunately, it's fairly unbalanced.  It is evident that Black Sigil's battle system was inspired by games like Chrono, Lunar, and Lufia, but it ends up not working as well as those 16-bit titles.  The battle system is like Chrono in the sense that it features three characters that can use combination attacks and are able to obtain a maximum of 999 HP; it's like Lunar in the sense that the characters can move in battle; and it's like Lufia with its cross-shaped icon menu.  None of these aspects of the battle system are poor concepts, but the way in which they are executed is flawed.

One of the things that made Chrono great is that there were no random battles.  Black Sigil throws that idea out the door and assaults you with more battles than an NES RPG.  It gets pretty ridiculous when you're literally fighting battles every one or two steps.  Later in the game, there's a piece of equipment that lowers the encounter rate, but even then, you still have more encounters than most RPGs out there.  Traversing the world map is especially painful because of this issue.  Unlike Chrono, you walk around on the world map, and crawling at a snail's pace is only made worse when you're barraged with enemy assaults almost every step.  I felt like I died and went to Heaven the moment I obtained an airship.  For awhile there, I was wishing my characters were limbless, so I didn't have to walk another step.

Not only are you brutally assaulted with endless random encounters, but they're also hellishly long.  It takes about 8 seconds for your characters' time gauges to fill up, and then you usually have to weather several rounds before a battle ends.  One to two minute battles were getting ridiculous, so I made an effort to constantly stock up on loads of healing items and potions to replenish my MP, so I could assault the enemies with endless magic attacks.  Some parts of the game dragged on forever, since my abilities were quite pathetic initially, but once I completed some sidequests and gained several spells that attacked all enemies, things got better.

Frequent slow battles are probably enough to deter all but the hardest of the hardcore RPG OGs, but they were made even worse by the fact that your characters can get stuck in battle.  The way Black Sigil's battle system is set-up is that you take three characters into battle.  You can arrange their order, but you can't give them an ideal starting point on the battlefield.  The problem with this is, your characters will often get stuck behind terrain and other characters, so they're left helpless, unless they have magic abilities or long-range weapons that can reach around walls.  This was just clumsy programming, and I know the developers could have done something about this if there was more time.

Also, you're often ambushed by bosses.  Sometimes save points are infrequent, so this can be especially brutal.  Certain boss fights require you to have items equipped to a particular character (there is no stockpile of items to take into battle in Black Sigil), so you can easily hit the game over screen if you aren't prepared.  This especially sucks if you've spent over an hour in a long dungeon without hitting a save point.  Some dungeons are mazelike with exits that are difficult to see, and they also can feature brutal enemies that use status effects that cripple your entire party.  I only had a few of these near- death experiences during long periods of play, but I should mention that I'm a veteran when it comes to RPGs.  Rookies, will likely get slaughtered in the early parts of the game if they don't pay close attention to their characters and stock up on loads of items.  Like a good scout, you should ""Be Prepared"".

Before moving on, I have one last negative comment to stain Black Sigil's reputation.  This wasn't a major issue, as it only happened two times in one dungeon, but I actually had the game freeze on me.  At first, I wondered if it was my DSi, because I had played 22 hours of Black Sigil without experiencing any problems, but after perusing some Internet forums, sure enough, it looks like Black Sigil sometimes has freezing issues.  Apparently, this problem isn't too big of an issue, but you may experience a couple freezes late in the game, so make sure to save frequently.

Black Sigil may have some serious issues with its battle system, but you'll likely enjoy the many references made to your favorite 16-bit RPGs.  Some of these references are very subtle, while others are quite noticeable.  Avid RPG fans will likely notice that many of the character animations are pulled directly from Chrono Trigger.  The laughing, running, and spell casting animations, will all remind you of that epic, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Besides featuring similar animations and sound effects (such as the breeze found in Narshe), Black Sigil also has many events that draw on your nostalgia for the RPGs of yore.  One scene will remind you of the Battle for Narshe where you divide into three parties.  Another will remind you of the mysteries surrounding Gau.  There are many moments like this that make you yearn for the days of old, but thankfully, they don't detract from Black Sigil's already great storyline.

The last element of Black Sigil I'd like to cover is the music.  The soundtrack isn't quite as varied as FFVI, but what is there is excellent.  Black Sigil's musical score will likely remind you of Suikoden, Chrono Trigger, and even Chrono Cross.  The musical themes are quite emotional, and really add to the experience despite being midi files.  Black Sigil's music really makes you feel the magic of Bel Lenora, and there are plenty of songs that perfectly complement each scene.  As in many RPGs, one song will likely grow repetitive, however--and that's the battle theme.  I actually really enjoyed the battle theme, despite it not being upbeat like Lufia 2, but it grew stale after being forced to hear it thousands of times.  Studio Archcraft should have taken a page from Namco's Tales series and created multiple battle themes, but that's a minor flaw present in most RPGs.

Black Sigil clearly has a number of issues that will detract from your enjoyment of the game, but the music, storyline, characters, and artwork made it worthwhile in my opinion.  I would have bestowed Black Sigil with a lofty 9.0 if it weren't for the major flaws with its battle system, but sadly, I have to subtract a few points.  Due to the problems with the battle system, only the most hardcore RPGs will enjoy Black Sigil.  If Studio Archcraft would have spent more time balancing the game, it could have been an amazing experience that would rival the best RPGs the SNES had to offer.  Unfortunately, I just can't recommend it unless you're willing to brave the battles to see everything else the game has to offer.  Still, I'm quite impressed with what Studio Archcraft accomplished with their first RPG.  Until hitting the incredibly short credits, I didn't realize that most of the game was produced by fewer people than the number of fingers on your hand.  After seeing the credits, it didn't surprise me that the game took four years, considering the incredible amount of detail in this 40-hour game.  Since Studio Archcraft made such a noble effort, I'd hope that fans of old-school RPGs would give this a shot, because I'm sure this development team could accomplish something amazing with their next project.  Black Sigil may not have lived up to Chrono Trigger, but it's still an adventure worth experiencing for those who miss what is often considered the golden age of RPGs--the 16-bit era.

----
Seems great for big heads.  Initially the headset didn't seem like it would be forgiving to giant noggins like mine but seems to not have excessive pressure so as to squeeze your ears.  The design isn't off the noise cancelling or noise blocking type, even though they do encase the ears completely.  The design of the mic is very nice as well, bends any which way and keeps it's shape.  The audio portion seems nice as well, adds depth and ""volume"" (no pun intended) to audio.

Becomes ""wireless"" when used exclusively in Xbox One mode, meaning it attaches to the audio connector that attaches to the Xbox One controller.  Only drawback I can see from this headset is the game, chat, volume and bass boost are only functional as an Xbox One peripheral via the audio connector.  Had these features been extended to the headset for use in all modes this would have been perfect.

Also comes with a micro usb cable for updating if needed from the Xbox One controller.
----

So apart from the One, the Four has more ear padding so your ears don't touch the drums or membranes of the headset.  I found I like this  design.  Also, it appears to have much more or just simple mic controls over the One version, in that it's easier to talk to someone in the room that is not playing the game with you, ie parent or other being.

These are great headsets for the price to features ratio but Turtle Beach seems to be limiting themselves by marketing these as only working with Xbox One, etc etc.  Though the wireless adapter portion is strictly Xbox One, the headsets work with anything that accepts 3.5mm audio connectors.  I tested this on a pc laptop, sound was great.",Great headset,1419292800,,{'Style:': ' New'},

Sims 3 is a major... drain on your PC, it's true. It's not nearly as much of an overhaul graphically or even gameplay-wise as Sims 2 seemed it was to the original, but then again, how could it be when there was such a leap forward in playability between there.

The Sims 3 gets a lot of grief for not being able to play multiple families, if there was one thing I see over and over and over, that is it; but you CAN play multiple houses within the same game, if you bother to look deep enough within the menus, buried in there is the option to change which ""active household"" you're playing--or, crazy enough, someone could just learn to read instructions which clearly point the way (once you do it once or twice you are unlikely to forget the simple click-thru routine).

That aside, the Sims themselves this time around are much more ""living"" people rather than being barbie-dolls that you must tell to do everything and anything, they really seem to have some greater spirit involved in everything they do, from animations to decisions they have, and especially the upgraded ""Wishes"" system (aka ""Aspirations"" from Sims 2) all tend to feel more organic, with much more rewarding goals to earn with all of those Lifetime points. Instead of buying silly things like life plants and face changing vanities, there are many-leveled, permanent gamechangers that change how your sim interacts with the world (eg. Observant helps your sim almost-instantly pickup on friends' personality traits for better conversations, Slacker helps your sim slack off at work while still getting a good performance, and so many more).

Between this new wish/reward system and the new ""Style creator"", this is easily worth the money. With the Style Creator it takes the idea that the Sims 2 introduced--of being able to click on some furniture or wall patterns or appliances--and added it to virtually anything you can buy or build within the game, making EVERYTHING that's material now virtually customizable! It truly opens up the aesthetics of the game, which helps to feel immersed and like this is your own.

The connection at the top of the controller seems a little loose to me, and the USB connector for the computer does as well. However, it also means you don't have to apply a lot of pressure to put the connectors in place, which can be a plus for folks who are worried about jamming things in.

The buttons are nice and responsive, and after my last controller, feel very easy on the hands. The F710 Logitech had buttons that needed a LOT of tension to activate; this controller feels almost like a feather in comparison. It also means that holding down the triggers is a responsive breeze.

The vibration on the controller is very strong. Definitely works better than I thought it might since I'm playing the PC ports of a lot of games that I used to play on Xbox and Playstation. The only thing I have NOT done with this controller is tried to use it with emulator programs of any sort. My review for most of my games on Steam and Origin, (like Dead Space 3, Batman: Arkham City/Knight/Origins and such) has been glowing.

The only reason I don't give it the full 5 is for the price. It was a DAMN pricey controller compared to my 20 dollar logitech. But... you get what you pay for.

Also since it was downloaded there was nothing to worry about for whatever issues there are/may have been with the disc.

I've played it through and you now have 3 game saves, can rewind and can play with more/less assistance which i guess would be their easy/normal mode.

The game is an interesting way to approach a zombie series but it's definitely not take down hordes of zombies with awesome weapons and insane slow motion kills. The game is character driven based on the decisions you make and at the end of the chapter it gives the statistics of who else made the same decisions as you did. Some decisions you make will create a response later in the chapter and a few will reflect the entire game. Some decisions are timed and give you less time to think before you choose an answer but as I accidentally discovered, if you just press the xbox button in the center of your controller it pauses the entire game and you can decide at leisure if you really wanted to.

Not that plot really matters in games like these, but what you get in Splinter Cell Essentials is sort of hokey. You've been captured while visiting your daughter's grave, and the people who have caught you go over various missions you've done. As they talk about them, you relive them in your head. This gives the game the ability to leap wildly from situation to situation without any connection at all between them.

I know that PSP controls are going to be more challenging than console controls, but I play a LOT of PSP games. These were just not well designed. Sure, you can get used to them - you can get used to pretty much anything. Still, they could have done a much better job setting up and implementing the PSP controls to provide smooth gameplay.

The graphics are a mixed bag. On one hand, I love the Splinter Cell environment with the various goggles and how the characters animate and react. On the other hand, there's no real shadows, much of the game is dark, and the camera was just AWFUL in several different situations. I've had it go into a super-close zoom while I was trying to navigate in a difficult situation, and I had to play by feel. You're not supposed to be the Blind Sam Fisher.

I like the voice work and the general characters in this series. I also adore this style of gameplay, sneaking along and attempting to infiltrate without being seen. That being said, it seemed like there were a few 'blast away' sections - and not enough set-up to allow you to sneak well.

I think if they'd spent more time in beta-testing, they could easily have worked out some of these control issues and the camera issues. Especially since they were in many cases re-hashing existing situations, so they didn't have to build the characters, environments or moves from scratch. It feels rushed to me.

I have made MANY visits to the ""Tube"" to understand this game.  I have been a RE fan since game 1.  I've watched the series grow, stumble, grow a little more, go completely away from the series, and finally upright itself.  RE 2 Revelations is a great change of place since RE 5, 6, and Resident Evil Revelations.  I mean, who can really be scared about fighting blobs of goo, moving rocks, and other throwaway monsters.  I will list my pros and cons:

Pros:  The actual game play itself is relative easy.  The creatures are way more scary (some actually look like ZOMBIES)!  There are the invisible kind, which I had quite a bit of trouble with, mutations within mutations, and some kick-butt bosses.  Since you have to play with BOTH members of your ""team,"" you will need to learn to get a move-on.  Creatures do not wait for you to combine your weapons, change your weapons, or even administer health.  This game was indeed more survival horror instead of what we've seen since RE5.

Cons:  Please keep in mind these are MY cons.  All you guys that I would consider PROS at this probably will get a good laugh and tell me to start watching TV again!  Keep in mind that I'm 62 and probably don't know HALF of what you guys know, so just bear with me.  I do not like the way you change your weapons.  RE Revelations was more simple and easier.  I also don't believe I'll ever under the ""mercenaries"" game.  I don't understand the concept of ""destroying"" your weapons.  You also cannot interchange your acquired parts.  All the characters come pre-equipped with weapons, so you never really can earn any kick-butt new ones ( or can you?).

It is not about world or european history. It is about American history, about American elections, and about American leaders. It presents a very accurate portrayal of the election process. You can pick from the various 2004 possible Presidential candidates or design one yourself and use it in campaign mode to unlock future possible candidates (Condeleeza Rice) and historical ones (Washington, Roosevelt) You post ads, give speeches, establish campaign HQs, gather endorsements, pick a Vice President, and talk to the media.

I usually use logitech mice but wanted to try out the Scimitar with RGB to go along with my RGB style computer build.  Yes I know RGB is a fad but god those colors are attractive!

Anyways per my custom here is my pro-cons list and then a general conclusion:

PROS:
 - Corsair Quality, Corsair is a very good brand that makes quality products from cooling to SSDs.  This mouse is obviously manufactured well and has a great sleek feel to it.
- RBG - Colors on the mouse, yes it's just for looks, but it does look nice! The mouse sticks out far and apart from my logitech.
- Macro keys on the side.  The buttons you can see in the picture are the selling point for this type of mouse.  I was hesitant at first because ""dear god, how am i going to push any particular one of those buttons mid-game?"" - However, while there is some truth to that sentiment the macro keys actually do work better than expected.  I think the trick is to be realistic when deciding HOW to use them.  For me, as a casual wow player among MANY other games, the trick was primarily to use them for PVE situations.  I could macro a less often used key there and it paid off in that capacity.  Something id normally be digging around in my bags for I could just macro it to that key and done.  I do not see how, unless you are some kind of savant, you can utilize the keys in intense game-modes (pvp etc.) but they are very nice as a kind of luxury for general game play otherwise.

CONS:
- The only con I have is that the mouse is a little large for my taste.  Not incredibly so, but I have slightly smaller than average hands so this shouldnt be an issue for most people.  After a month of using it however I don't really notice it anymore.

Cataclysm was underwhelming for me and I liked Mists of Pandaria, but I got bored and ended up not playing for a year (I kept my account open, but played other games instead of logging in to WoW).

Warlords is the best leveling experience I've ever had in World of Warcraft.  This is the first time I've actually enjoyed leveling so much that I immediately went and leveled my alt up to 100 as well.  And I have a third character at 93 already.  That's fast for me, I'm not huge in to leveling and playing alts.  The storyline is immersive and I love how it coordinates with the garrison.  I had mixed feelings about the garrisons when I first heard about them, but once I started playing I fell in love.  It's just really cool to see it build up and see how it interacts with your character as you progress.  I don't want to give away story spoilers, but there's one point in Shadowmoon Valley where you gather your garrison for a big fight and it's pretty cool.  The cut scenes and story progression in Warlords are also amazing.  I haven't felt this immersed in the story since the whole Wrathgate storyline in WOTLK (which still gives me goosebumps).

A lot of people have complained about garrisons feeling like a chore after 100, but I haven't experienced that at all.  I'm using the herb garden to slowly level my alt's herbalism.  I try to mine/herb every day, but if I miss a day or two here and there it's really no big deal.  I think people have if in their heads that they MUST do everything every day and you know what?  You don't have to!  I craft things and sell things and have made over 700k gold without even worrying about missing a day on my cooldowns or forgetting to mine on my alt.

The followers have become a bit of an obsession though, and I love the little ""mini game"" that is collecting and leveling and gearing followers.  I slacked off some on this at first, so I'm just now getting followers high enough ilevel to do the Highmaul missions and I love it!  I'm a former raider who just does casual LFR and normal modes now, so it's nice that I might be able to get a piece of gear or two from my followers.

Dungeons in WoD are also pretty awesome.  I think Grimrail Depot is my favorite so far - I think it's so cool to see the landscape flashing by as you fight bad guys on a train!  I've done Highmaul on normal and LFR and the raid is pretty fun.  I'm loving the Brackenspore fight - as a healer it's awesome to have something slightly different to do besides watching player health bars on grid nonstop.

There are a few things that I dislike about the expansion, and the biggest one is professions.  I feel like they got completely nerfed and are almost useless these days.  Ore is no longer prospectable and there's only one gem (which you can only get using garrison and a JC daily cooldown).  Gem slots have been nerfed to where it's very rare for gear to have a gem slot anymore.  I was never a huge gold making nut, but I really miss being able to shuffle some ore to make a little gold here and there.  My jewelcrafting seems completely useless these days.  Having one gem and a half dozen cuts is not much fun. :( I feel the same about my other professions as well.  I used to be able to craft belt buckles with my blacksmith, but those are gone too.  I can craft one epic every few weeks (and characters can only wear 3 crafted items TOTAL now) and that's about the extent of my professions these days.  It's a huge letdown considering how expansive and fun professions used to be.  I realize Blizzard was trying to make them less required, but honestly, I liked it a lot better the way it was before.

Also, at the risk of sounding like a huge whiner, I miss flying. I'm doing fine without it and I'm totally fine with not being able to fly til max level, but now that I've been 100 for several weeks I miss it.  A lot!

Other than those two things, this expansion has been absolutely amazing.  I love the direction World of Warcraft is going and as a 10 year player, I don't see myself leaving anytime soon.  I may play a little less hardcore these days, but WoW is still (BY FAR) the best MMO out there and this expansion solidified that for at least the next few years.

4.0,False,"09 14, 2008",A42CJC66XO0H7,B000HCU7B8,Scott Schimmel,"Guild Wars surprised me.  For a free MMORPG, it has a surprisingly deep story.  There's a fairly large, vaguely Egypt/Middle East-inspired world, a selection of eight character classes to pick from, dozens of quests, and an extra-difficult end-game mission or two.  There are secrets to find, NPC heroes to recruit and equip, and missions with some interesting goals and mechanics.  The difficulty level is fairly challenging, and it ramps up pretty well as your character levels up -- in the main story, it never feels overwhelming (partly because of those NPC heroes, who first appeared in the Nightfall campaign).  There's little or no need to ""grind"" to level up.

Oh, and there's no monthly fee to play.

Nightfall is a solid middle ground between the first campaign, Prophecies, which provides a lengthy, slow introduction to the game, and the second, Factions, which provides a quick but more-difficult route to the level cap of 20.

It's not without issues -- some areas are a bit repetitive, there's a place or two where you might not be sure where to go next, and pathfinding can be sketchy at times.  But the solid story and hours of gameplay make up for the minor inconveniences.","If you're going to play Guild Wars, start here",1221350400,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

-An artwork book that is of high quality, the heft of this tome cannot be understated. The grand designs found within are evocative of the works of great doodle masters such as any of the artists working on South Park or Mrs. Havercamp, my third grade elementery school teacher.

-A tchotchke (Diablo's head), which serves as a clever container for the USB memory stick containing the previous Diablo games and (oddly) also possesses a chemical smell much like spray paint. The tchotchke head and USB memory stick were quite obviously held in such high regard by Blizzard, that they were placed within their own container, packed carefully, much as you would expect to find a Rolex watch or perhaps a crown jewel or two.

-Several guest key codes on laminated cards, that I can only surmise are collectors keepsakes in and of themselves.

-A Music CD and 'Behind the Scenes' Video DVD are included; regrettably the Music CD is packaged in a very thin plastic case, which in turn is encapsulated within a cardboard paper case. I am hesitant to open this as the extraneous cover is likely to become easily worn out.

-Of course the game DVD itself comes, as would be expected, in the standard DVD style enclosure that is characteristic of any DVD sold. Included within this caisson

The outer box is not made of real ivory or bone after all, so I am disappointed that the box itself is not an heirloom that I will be able to pass on to my grandchildren. However, it is made of precision manufactured steam compressed wood pulp that seems to be very robust, and I am grateful for that much.

Unlike the Diablo II Collectors Edition, which I am also the proud owner of, this collector edition does not seem to have a serial number stamped on the back of the box. My Diablo II box is stamped 43,xxx of 75,000. There is a number stamped on the bottom of the box, but since it is in the 7 million range, it is almost certainly the part number for the box itself.

The complete package is most impressive due to its weight, in large part a result of the hard cover artwork book inside. The box is also quite large. I thought the Diablo II box had a bit too much girth, as if Blizzard felt that a typical box size of that era would be unable to do justice to the variety of contents it was comprised of. The voluminous capaciousness of the Diablo III box is an order of magnitude greater. Precisely placed at the bottom of this portmanteau of joys is a finely crafted piece of injected molded plastic, which very deftly holds in place all of the contents. In all, the package is a great achievment, and one can not help but give kudos to the artisans that brought together all of these wonders in one tidy package for the world to enjoy.

That's right, I have not felt it necessary to purchase any new video games in over two years because Starcraft 2 is still keeping me entertained.

I don't think I'll need to detail all of the bullshit problems that this game had at first. From terrible map design and severely imbalanced units to Battle.net 2.0's absent social scene, the game's issues have all been well documented in the bevy of one- and two-star reviews on this site from 2010. I think the problem with Amazon reviews for computer games that are constantly patched is that the reviews never get updated to keep up with what the game is currently, and to me SC2 is a perfect example.

With the most recent patch, the cold, sterile Bnet 2.0 has been greatly revamped and, while still not perfect, it's a drastic improvement that makes the game much more sociable. Blizzard's recent balance changes have the game running in a very fair way (no matter what some Terran players might say) and play styles are constantly evolving, so it can feel like a brand new game every few months when you have to figure out new ways to play against changing opponents.

The biggest draw, for me anyway, of SC2 is the amazing professional scene. There are events nearly every weekend, and I've spent more time watching Starcraft 2 pro matches this year than my beloved, inept, extremely frustrating Chicago Cubs, and the high-level play progamers exhibit gives the average ladder warrior something to strive towards. It's this aspect of Starcraft that has kept me coming back time and time again, and I think the only thing that'll stop me from booting up Wings of Liberty is the release of Heart of the Swarm.

TLDR: It's a much better game than it was at launch, three-star rating be damned. I would probably wait until Heart of the Swarm is released some time early next year before jumping into SC2, but if you feel compelled to start playing before the expansion hits, I doubt you will regret it.",This is not the same shoddy game it was at launch,1345680000,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I played 1.0 on the Wii U, and bought this value pack for PS4.

Overall, I find the PS4 graphics to be way better than the Wii U 1.0 version.  Things load faster, Toy Box mode runs a lot quicker etc.

The inclusion of the Spiderman playset in this bundle is nice.  However you run around in a city that is basically the same as the Avenger playset.  That was a little disappointing as the variety isn't really there in the playsets - you run around and collect things.  Or go from point a to point b, fight, then go to point c, etc.  They removed the green capsules from 1.0 - I miss collecting toys by getting to hard to reach places.

Fortunately the included Rocket Raccoon figure can ""cross over"" into the Avengers playset - so all figures are usable in playsets with this bundle (and of course all are useful in Toy Box mode).

Overall - I would recommend this to anyone.  It is a great improvement over the original and has kept my family actively playing for weeks.

FYI - I did consider buying the big PS4 bundle that includes early access to Hulk - but if you price that out individually, you are paying a ton of money for that Frost Giant stand (which doesn't impact gameplay).  If you are a collector, that is nice - but as a game player, that was too much - I felt this bundle was a much better deal when priced individually.",Nice improvement over 1.0,1413244800,3,"{'Edition:': ' Premium Value Pack', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

There are so many fun things to do with this game besides the main missions! You can frisk any and every person on the street for drugs or illegal weapons--though you might tick a few off enough to fight you! If you get to certain parts of town (the rougher neighborhoods) you can just stand there and watch the street crimes happen around you! And it's your choice as to how to stop them. If you take the people down and arrest them, you earn a ""Good Cop"" rating, but if you choose to just blow them away, you earn a ""Bad Cop"" rating. While this doesn't affect gameplay much, it will affect the ending of the game. The missions are fairly linear, but it's the ""between mission"" activities that set this game apart. You can go to the gym and improve your fighting skills (you can't do much to start out with), or go to the shooting range to get better weapons with your score (and don't expect to just walk in and start shooting-some of the targets fire back!). You're going to have to remember where everything is though, because you might have a hard time finding a hospital/first-aid station when you're really needing one in the 200+ miles of LA you're driving through. If you enjoy GTA, this is definitely one to buy. The cars handle differently, so if you're chasing a perp in a stolen vehicle, you'd better think twice before commandeering a limo to chase them with! One warning: the language here is serious, so it easily earns it's ""M"" rating. The only other major gripe with this game is the camera angles. You could be fighting several guys at once and have your character all of the sudden staring at the camera with no enemy in sight. And try chasing a mugger down the street when you can't even see what's going on! By the time you adjust the camera to get behind your character again, it's too late.

I don't know what is in some people's head, but don't believe the negativity. If you enjoyed the first two Batman games in this series, or if you haven't even played the other two games, you will enjoy this game. This game is just like the other two, not much different, but how much different can you make it, it's Batman. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Some people are upset because the Joker plays a major role in this game. What would Batman be without the Joker, his nemesis! He was fun in the other two games and he is fun in this game, albeit Mark Hamill did a better Joker voice. People must also realize that this is a prequel, so it makes sense that the Joker would be in the game again. There are some frustrating moments like some freezes here and there but nothing that makes you throw your controller and not play the game. People who played the game on day one release complained about some technical issues which is why I rarely play games on day one because updates are sure to come. I bought the game on day one but didn't play it until a week later. Soon as I popped it in, updates needed to be downloaded. No major problems for me yet. I will say that I enjoyed Batman: Arkham City more, but this game is still fun, fun, fun... With all there is to do, it is worth the money, and I don't say that often!
Addendum: After 45 hours of playing and reaching 44% completion, it happened. During the Blackgate prison sequence in search of the Joker, the game glitched. It was a major glitch that made the game unplayable from that point on. The game did not do what it was supposed to do and I could not progress. I'm stuck in limbo with nowhere to go! Needless to say, I had to start the whole game over. This is totally unacceptable for a game that cost sixty bucks! Up until this point I was having loads of fun with the game.

4.0,False,"08 4, 2008",A2KI0LAYW1AM7R,B000FDN3HE,Machina,"After trying out the demo, I bought the game on a chance that it was going to be good. I've heard from a few people that it was good and I've read good reviews, but the demo was discouraging because it didn't give you an idea of the story. Technically it did, but it wasn't made aware. It seemed like I completed the story, which was a weird thing to happen in a demo.

The story to the game is as follows: This scientist created a world with really good AI; green computer people that have digital souls. These are the Darwinians. They live in Darwinia. But virii have attacked them and now you have to kill them and replendish the Darwinian population. You help the Darwinians and the scientist with this task. This is pretty much it. Throughout the game, though, the scientist explains how the entire world of Darwinia works. He explains all about Darwinia and the Darwinians and how they are created, live, evolve and what happens when they die. It's interesting.

The game starts out slow paced and speeds up later. This is about the same time when you get to the red Darwinians, corrupt versions. They also start getting more creative with level design and you'll need to use more strategy to win. There are a few levels, though, that look really difficult, due to so many enemies, but are way too easy. Still, at times, the game has me asking, ""What are they going to hit me with next?""

You may wonder what the scientist is doing while you're here doing all the killing. Throughout the game, he works on updating the programs (weapons and other tools) that you use in the game to help you. He either increases efficiency or adds new capabilities to them. And you get to choose what you want him to update. You won't have time throughout the game to update all of them so, choose well.

Other than a few questionable level designs, the game lacks polish elsewhere. In some of the last few levels, having the sound quality turned all the way up induces crashes in later levels. There is no patch available yet, so tuning it down is the only option. You still get a lot of slow downs and pauses. It's annoying, but never got me killed.

The game's strongest point is its display of personality. Every time you start the game, a different introduction shows. It cycles through a hand full of them. The game also does a good job of making you feel connected to the Darwinians by personifying them through the stories the scientist tells you. And the graphics close the deal; they are most unique and colorful.

Overall, the game stands as a simple strategy, providing hours of fun for even non-strategy gamers. The price also helps drown out the lack of polish.",Surprisingly entertaining.,1217808000,,,

Drum navigation is nice because then you don't have a guy banging around on the drums and making you go through menus.
Bass petal is solid and works well.

Guitar:
Keys and neck feel sturdy. Strum bar is solid and quiet. I really like playing with the higher frets.
Freestyle guitar solos are a lot of fun. Amp feedback sounds cool as you tilt your guitar and play during freestyle. Nob allows you to switch the sound of feedback.

Microphone:

Cord is longer

Bass:
No new features.
Would be neat if they introduced bass solos to make the instrument more enticing to play.

Menu:
Auto calibration works perfect.
Playing a show is fun. It lets you play song after song and vote on which song is next, to end the show, or play an encore. This seems ideal in a party setting and will help you pick songs quickly and keep the show rocking.

Cons:

Free style guitar solos feel gimmicky after a while and will make you want to just hear the normal solo after a while.
Freestyle vocals are hard to activate at times. You need to fill the whole gold bar with random words else it won't activate.
No online play (yet?)
No microphone connection on the instruments for party chat.
Wish microphone was wireless as the other instruments are.
Sometimes instruments lose sync during song. Not sure why?
The avatars you make cant be used as standins (other instruments played by AI) which I hope is patched.
You cant do batch downloads and have to download DLC individually.

It carries on the tradition of excellent third-person shooting action serving as the foundation for a twisting plot of intrigue and conspiracy. A sensitive incident at a refinery in Alaska leads to an investigation by agent Gabe Logan and his covert team. What they uncover is not what they expected and when things just don't add up they dig deeper, slowly adding pieces to the puzzle of a deadly conspiracy. In order to keep up with the story, it's important to find hidden evidence on each level and read the files in your inventory. They provide essential details to story progress. Without them (they aren't necessary), it's sometimes difficult to figure out the whos and whys of what is going on. The twists and turns come fast, and apart from the occasional unaccounted for gap due to missing intel, the story is solid. Deception abounds and Dark Mirror feels more like a mystery than past tactical espionage-oriented Syphon Filter games.

This time around, the missions are presented in smaller pieces with simpler designs. You can sit down and play through one part of a mission in under 10 minutes. There are checkpoints within these bite-sized areas at critical locations so you never have to backtrack far if you die or do something that results in mission failure. The levels themselves are fairly straightforward and linear, but it doesn't feel too constrained and there is room for tactical experimentation, as well as secrets to find.

Most of the time you will be moving, sneaking, shooting, aiming and taking cover. Stealth has always been a staple of Syphon Filter, and it is well represented in Dark Mirror. Doing things quietly often ensures resistance along your path is lighter. However, stealth is not necessary in most cases, and there is no severe punishment for attempting it and being caught. You can get a rush of anticipation as you sneak around your quarry, or you can get a rush of adrenalin when they spot you and assault you full force. However you want to play it, Dark Mirror will accommodate you.

When you do get into trouble, you can now take cover along walls or behind obstacles. This is a new addition to Syphon Filter gameplay and while it isn't a new gaming concept, it has been done properly here. Not sticking your neck out needlessly can save your life, but with Dark Mirror's fairly easy difficulty you can usually opt to just stand in the open and fire if you're quick on the trigger. Again, this allows casual gamers to enjoy the action while allowing more tactically-minded individuals to be more deeply involved in the battlefield.
Enemies are unpredictable yet intelligent, many times using cover as you would. When they have you outnumbered they take advantage of the situation to put pressure on you and ferret you out.

There is a very nice assortment of weapons and devices for Gabe and company to use. Pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, submachineguns, experimental weaponry, explosives, grenades, etc. At any one time you can carry one sidearm, one submachinegun, one rifle (sniper or otherwise), the experimental agency rifle you carry at all times, a melee weapon, and an explosive. The experimental rifle shoots darts of various types: explosive, poison gas or electric shock. Firearms have varying attributes and fire modes, so some are better under certain circumstances. Generally speaking though, most any gun can get the job done for you, so it's almost never a matter of not having the right tool for the job. With all of these toys at your disposal, it's a ton of fun for anyone who loves guns. Again, Dark Mirror makes itself accessible to casual gamers and hardcore shooter fans alike.
You also have access to a set of high-tech goggles that have three different modes: night vision, infra-red, and electromagnetic.
Armor and medkits are places around the levels and provide a quick refresh after particularly intense areas.

The graphics are neat and clean. While the PS2 can push out more dazzle than is presented in Dark Mirror, this game succeeds in looking fantastic in it's simplicity. If you're used to the high-end CG cutscenes of late, you may be a little disappointed in the movies Dark Mirror provides, but the in-game action still looks good.
The sound is decent, with some good voice acting and a lot of spoken lines during play. I can't help but feel there could be a little more oomph to the guns and some more environmental sounds, but again Dark Mirror succeeds in its simplicity. The music is provided by several composers, including the ubiquitous Mark Snow. Nothing terribly rousing here, but it keeps pace with the highs and lows of the action.

Despite these easy to swallow portions, and an emphasis on simplicity, there is a lot on the table to enjoy, and Dark Mirror offers about 10 hours of story playtime. In addition, there is a Mission Mode where you can replay levels and earn ratings in tactical areas such as headshots, stealth kills, use of rifle darts, survivability, and knife skills. For your performances, you are awarded badges of merit, and these patches unlock additional weapons, abilities such as increased health, and new bonus levels. Earning full ratings for each level usually requires you to play through it a few more times, each time focusing on a different tactic. Due to the quick-fire nature of the missions, this is quick and fun, but can eat up a lot of time in the long run, making Dark Mirror very replayable.

Dark Mirror is quite enjoyable. It doesn't shoot itself in the foot by catering to casual or hardcore action gamers. Instead, it allows for both, and does so admirably.

On a final note, Dark Mirror was brought over to the PS2 after being made for the PSP. Everything was designed for quick portable gaming in mind. This accounts for the short mission structure, somewhat easy gameplay (it's much easier to move and aim with a PS2 controller), and all-round simplicity as opposed to more complex games like SOCOM or Metal Gear Solid. Fortunately, Dark Mirror is a shining example that satisfying gameplay and quality content don't necessarily imply complexity.","A fun, accessible game that offers a solid, albeit light third-person shooter experience",1197244800,9,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

Granted, some days you just need to do that in a video game, but for long-term fun it just simply does not occur.  I am more of a fan of strategic games and absolutely loved the ""Rogue Spear"" title way back in the day (""Rogue Spear"" is a mix of first-person shooter and strategic planning for multiple teams).  Knowing little about what the Rainbow 6 franchise moved to, I purchased this title thinking it would be more like ""Rogue Spear"".  Unfortunately, it was not.

Now, that's not to say that I hated this game.  The storyline was quite interesting overall and there is clearly an effort to tie it in with a general Rainbow Six master storyline.  When playing, it does move towards being a ""run around and shoot stuff"" game, but it keeps some strategic elements to it that I hoped for.  For example, you have two assisting Rainbow Six swat officers that you can command around, such as sending them to clear a room, throw grenades, or hold position while you survey the area.  This is a ""bottom-up"" strategic approach, which is better than nothing in my mind, but I really hoped for a more ""top-down"" strategic approach.  The AI seems a little dumb... you can shoot terrorists by firing off a gun repeatedly, yet their buddies a level up seem to only think that ""something might be up.""  It's a step-up from older games where you could shoot one terrorist and his pal would continue smoking a cigarette over the dead body, but it's still a little peculiar.

Overall, if this had been only a game where you shot things, I would have given it 2 stars.  I gave it one more star for a creative story and another star for the ""bottom-up"" strategic planning.  It's certainly not the best game I've ever played, but it was not a total waste.

There are some shortcomings though. For one, the graphics would be much more impressive, if there were more zoom levels. There is all kinds of stuff going on, and I would like to see these things up close.
Also, I ended up running out of things to do on some of the courses. It would be nice if one could build more than one course on a property. For instance, I ended up building an 18 hole course on a lot that was a bit too small for it really. Therefore, I ended up building a course that was too short overall for tournements. But once I got more land, it was too much of a pain to redo it all. I wish I could have built a second 9-hole course, and perhaps even picked individual holes out of both courses, to make up an 18 hole championship course.
I also wished I'd have a bit more influence of the actual definition of a hole. While you are in full control of the actual layout of the hole, it is not possible to set whether it's a par 3, 4, or 5. It does so simply by length of the whole. If you build a very tricky hole however, the destination from the tee to the green may be short, but it may require to play the long way around. Therefore, par 3 clearly isn't right. Another issue is that each hole only has one tee. How about women's and champion tees?
Overall, constructing courses and holes is very straightforward. A very worthwhile game!

The Bad: Turning into a painting isn't as useful or fun as it should be, just A Link to the Past remake, short and too easy, 3D effects don't add much

So here I was thinking this game was going to be something completely new and exciting when I realized it was pretty much a port of A Link to the Past. That's not really a bad thing since many younger gamers have never played that game before. What I also didn't like was just how easy and short the game was. The dungeons themselves aren't really all that hard but more confusing and some puzzles are really hard to figure out. With that said the game is enjoyable but some may not like it.

It all comes down to feeling like every other Zelda game out there. There's not much to set this apart, and when you're done with it you will just shrug and move on to the next game. The dungeon layout and the bosses are clever and fun but I just wish there was more to this game. One thing I also didn't like was having to buy the equipment to keep it. If you rent equipment and die it will be sent back to Rovio's shop in which you have to go back to your house and rent it again, and return to the dungeon you were at. At least there are warp spots which is a serious lifesaver. In all honesty, if these weren't here I doubt most people would be able to stomach getting around.

Most dungeons involve a certain element or weapon. The boss in each dungeon also requires this weapon to defeat it. The sand rod, fire rod, ice rod, bomb, and various other weapons from past Zelda games make an appearance. However, the story involves Sages being turned into paintings and that's where the whole ""Link Between Worlds"" thing comes in. This feature is actually quite gimmicky and the game would have been fine without it. It's used as a segue between puzzles or just used briefly to get around. Flattening against a wall and shuffling side to side isn't exactly a game selling feature and I felt it was poorly used here.

The game's 8 dungeons may actually be enough for most people, especially Zelda fans. The most frustrating part was how to get to each dungeon since you can easily get lost or spend hours just wandering around aimlessly. The lack of direction has been abundant in the Zelda series and I feel needs to change. However, once again, some fans may be happy with this and that's fine.

Overall, A Link Between Worlds is one of the best games available on 3DS and a fine Zelda game. It's only issue is that it's the same type of Zelda we have played numerous times and not the revolutionary Zelda we have come to expect from games like Phantom Hourglass. The 3D effects don't really do much for the overall experience (like 99% of 3DS games) and can be just as enjoyable with the 3D turned off.","Plays it safe, don't expect anything new",1415577600,,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo 3DS'},
4.0,False,"07 12, 2009",AN81JUYW2SL24,B00140P9BA,Dr. Speed,"This review is mainly about the game and not its security features (activation or otherwise). As you know, the controversy about the sexual encounters in the game was blown totally out of proportion. The MOST you will see is Liara's bare bottom and back. I'd rate it somewhere around PG-13 content.

The music and soundtrack is incredible and apropos. It reminded me of Blade Runner and 1980s electronic music, and I wasn't surprised to read an interview of the designer for Mass Effect 2 described it the same way.

The interface is rather clunky at times, especially when ordering squad mates around or controlling their weapon usage. The Mako rover controls aren't THAT bad, but the physics engine is totally messed up. The DPV/FAV in Battlefield 2 has some decent physics and they should have modeled the Mako after that vehicle since it is also an EA game.

The weapons are usual run of the mill sci-fi stuff, nothing too extravagant. The best weapons to get are the Spectre Master gear when you have over 1 million credits and you are over Level 50. The best armor to get Is Colossus X, and I recommend getting the highest level Shield Modulator you can so you get extra shields.

The game play is annoying at times. There are lots of side missions like the ones in Oblivion or STALKER. Admiral Hackett wants you to investigate X in system Y. Admiral Hackett needs you to negotiate a situation, kill someone, or do something. If you finish the main plot, you cannot continue playing. Mass Effect 2 is supposed to change this, although I totally understand why Mass Effect 1 does not allow this. The Citadel takes a pounding in the main storyline at the end, so the designers would have had to make a new model for Citadel in case you continued playing.

The main plot is too short. Once I equipped my squad with decent hardware and weapons, all of the enemies were too easy. I spent 20 hours playing but I figure about 3-5 hours is all that is needed to finish the main story. All of the mineral searching and side missions became repetitious so I stopped doing that. Decrypting everything from probes, rocks (yes, you have to decrypt mineral samples), lockers, and cases got boring very quickly.

Pros: Immersive story and music. Decent voice acting as well. The graphics are not cutting-edge for a game that came out in 2007-2008. The hair on many of the characters looked fake.

Cons: Portions of the game play are repetitious and boring: rover driving, mineral searching, side missions, decrypting stuff, and the elevator loads.

This ""game"" clearly is targeted for beginning guitarists, with a twist...

The breakdown:
I already own several electric guitars so compatability was a also a question.
I can say as a teaching tool for learning guitar it is a phenomenal step forward.
It makes learning guitar much more fun, and cost effective.
It has an excellent track list of guitar solos, which will hopefully be expanded soon for additional metal and heavy rock.
Techniques and games are really a solid package for effective learning.
Response from the electric guitar to the XBOX has no issues after retuning.
Playing directly out of a sound system is the only way to play this ""game"", as distortion and lag direct from an HDMI connection is horrendous.
I immediately switch to my sound system and calibration was nearly perfect, as your sound system becomes your ""amp"".
Amp effects are creative and adjustable with successful progress.
Improvement is basically guaranteed if you invest the time.

The four aspects that could be improved in a future release are:
1)The ability to play in ""band"" (its a lonely game out there....)
2)Being able to select difficulty level before the game scales it up or down, have to learn a chord one string at a time, and have individual notes for 3-4 songs is really PAINFUL.
3)Not require constant validation of ""tuning"" with each song.  If you have a guitar that constantly goes out of tune, you probably need to replace the guitar!
4)Interface, which is bland, and not particularly user friendly or intuitive

There just is a little something the game lacks. The tacticts are just not quite tactical enough. If everything else fails, speed up the time and wait until you have maxed out your army and tech trees.

I have flaming arrows, but there is no visible clue?) to make them worth considering. You never find yourself researching just one more thing that will allow you to do X so your plan works out. The plan always is to send out troops in masses and pull units back when they get to weak. Researching never truely influences that plan a lot. You just may have to pull back and wait for some more research to up your stats, and then re-try your 'plan'.

The loading is about average, it's not long, but not short. Using the menu by punching to select & swiping to the the next/previous on the list expects a real full  one shoulder to the other swipe. You can also use the controller.
There are MANY real videos with the woman from the trailer (She's a black belt) about several topics of basic self defense. Quick instructions on how to make a real fist, which part of the hand for palm strikes & hammer strikes. Also, how to walk w/o looking like a victim, how to stand correctly so you don't loose your balance, etc. Unfortunately, these were buried under the Profiles/Extras menu & then again more swiping to find in that sub menu. Also you have to EARN these videos by doing the self defense, cardio, reflexes game modes first to unlock them. They are very informative & she has a good presence & isn't boring, but having them so buried & having to do sometimes 3/4 or more of the game to unlock them (though you don't have to be perfect at the attempts) is wrong.  (((**END EDIT**)))

Self-Defense
It teaches you about 2-4 moves that is shown for each segment & you do the first move, then the first 2 moves & so on.
The problem here is the CAMERA angle & teaching. I'm looking over my avatar's shoulder & cannot see how EXACTLY I'm suppose to rotate my hand. Also it's not always fully explained how forceful, or what part of my arm or hand I should use & what part of theirs specifically.
There is some verbal instruction, in fact, what is said is VERY good & not watered down. Such as at first, he will say to just, ""...slam down your foot on his."" But as you do it, he does explain further, ""...make sure you hit the tip of his toes, which are the most vulnerable & cause the most pain.""
These are real karate & kung fu (more fluid arm turns rather then hard blocks which are less jarring on the body) & other martial art moves that DO work well, but it leaves me wanting more instruction to know exactly how the attacker will react more. Here, the attacker always acts like he is so shocked by a defense move, he's like a deer in headlights which is the opposite of real life.
(((**EDIT**))) Now, a lot of people make fun of this game because at first it's always ""Kick the guy's nether regions"" but there are many palm strikes, back fists, circling the arms to get out of holds, etc. which are great. (((**END EDIT**)))
There is enough said to get the basic idea, don't get me wrong, but those like me who like more knowledge will want more. Also, on detection, sometimes I couldn't get the move right, though rare, but other times, I'm suppose to swing an attackers arm out by swinging mine, I just did wrist circle & it counted.

Cardio
It works well, though there is some fluff of step touching (lame) & clapping (really? really?!?!?) which I wasn't happy with at all. But there are punches, elbow strikes, uppercuts, etc. There are also back kicks & side kicks which I was happy to see, but wish there was even more emphasis on it. The classes are all about 2-5 minute each is WAY too short & about 10 of them. These are easy classes, though the animation seems a bit too sped up more then real life in that you might lose form keeping up or lose balance on the unfortunately few kick portions.
(((**EDIT**)))  The later classes have a lot of knee lifts & kicks & was a good workout. I actually liked the shorter workouts as you have to get near perfect on everything to score a lot of stars to get an achievement & if they seem short, you can just load more classes. (((**END EDIT**)))

Balance
To clarify, this is NOT yoga, but is Tai Chi, though it's not Short Yang style, which I know, but some other style. It IS more authentic then Your Shapes which is more half yoga, half Tai Chi in a random order. This segment really needed some commentary about the moves & how it helps the body. For people who don't want it, a simple ability to turn it off would appease all audiences. The later classes do have some small kicks (you don't have to kick high to get credit) & snake poses & was relaxing.

Reflex Training (best part)
Very extensive, takes place in a boxing ring, it has it's own levels for:
Dodging - dodge right/left, never always left & right, it does random which is great & even has you lean twice in succession.
Punching - basic, hooks, uppercuts
kicking - side, high & others
Block punches - blocking the trainers' punches to your face, side of the head & body
Blocking kicks - blocking the trainers' different kicks
I like that they show your body in the corner, though I had a little issue with the arrows (diff color for left/right even when he's hitting straight to your mid line (face/body), though practice fixed that. I also love they really emphasis form, though only a few verbal reminders, but the model shows it in the first level of each type. Again, more emphasis on verbal instruction & even more levels would have made this game a definite recommendation.
(((**EDIT**)))  The later levels at 8-10 really ramps up the speed like real life & since the punches are random, you really need to have reflexes/think fast to block them in time.  Although I wish there were more punches & blocks to add more variety which a real first person or see through very close third person would allow. (((**END EDIT**)))

This could have been such a great title. The people they used for knowledge on martial arts is well done & the fact form & it not being watered down is refreshing. The movements you need to do are like real life & is great. But the presentation, the animation, camera choice fails. The animations for your character & trainer are terrible. The camera angles are terrible.
This would have been great if your avatar was just a shadow outline of your own body & not some made up character & even first person view with red graphics to tell you where you did it wrong.
The instruction portion would have been better with a real video & highlighting or pausing the screen at key moments during the instruction portion. Even using a video during training would have worked to feel more real life. Even the animation of the speed in the cardio section seemed a bit too fast unless you already have extensive training/practice & each class was only a few minutes long.

I hope this or another company picks up this type of non-watered down martial arts & learns from this games mistakes to make a great game. This is a pretty good game & the only one of it's kind, so it's worth it for the small content. If Dance Central can do dancing with great detection & showing feedback, martial arts can be done as well.

My only complaint is the lack of customization when you initially create your character, very poor choice of options to make your character's face look unique at all from anyone else at all.  The oddest thing is, once you apply sunglasses or facepaint there is NO option to remove it EVER, you are permanently stuck with your glasses on etc.  You would think this could be easily added as an accessory in customization to apply or remove but nope, a hat, scarf, shoes, are interchangeable but not suglasses or facepaint lol!

4.0,False,"05 1, 2005",A3R56AWX8PRQLP,B0001XOJAS,Indy Reviewer,"Empire Earth 2 (EE2) is a worthy successor to Empire Earth (EE), filling a number of holes and adding massive amounts of content to the original game.  The play is frantic and tough and enough content's been added so that you can spend days on a single game.  I knock a star off both fun and overall for a combination of things making the game far more complex than it should - including inexcusably skimpy documentation - but this deserves 4/4 stars for fun and playability as a game that can keep you up late, late, late at night.

If you've never played 2001's EE, you should.  The concept here is pretty simple.  You control a civilization from the stone age through far in the future, but as this is a real-time strategy (RTS) game you can't stop the clock like you do in Civ, meaning you're constantly fighting off opponents along the way.  The real issue is why you should buy this over EE.  The simplest way I can put it is to compare the original Civilization versus Civilization II, where the two games were both popular but for different reasons.  The first one created a genre and became a classic.  The second, while not nearly original, fixed holes and added massive layers of complexity to the first game.

Simply put, there's a lot more in EE2 than there was in EE.  With 300 differing units (versus 200 in EE), more civs, and any number of new variables ranging from weather to tech advances to temporary bonuses, it means that the old ""hold off the barbarians by building Hadrian's Wall until you advance and build 10 leviathans to do a Sherman's March through Georgia"" RTS strategy doesn't work here.  At higher difficulty levels, the AI has gotten a lot better.  As well, civilizations are more balanced.  The two combine to force you to really have to know the ins and outs of both your civ and your opponent to win.  Everything (resource management, unit management, battle strategy, and far more advanced diplomacy and battle plan coordination) becomes important to watch, especially at higher difficulty levels.  The downside is it's a major pain trying to keep up with everything, but if you can it's a blast.  The fact this is multiplayer-ready straight out of the box is also an improvement, as well as significant tweaking of handicap levels in multiplayer games that make the potential of newbie versus veteran matchups actually playable for a change.

Where this loses a star on both fun and overall is that they didn't do enough to make the information overload easier to manage.  There are a couple nice new features in the UI (the Citizen Manager is helpful but I find multiple screens just make things even more confusing) but nothing revolutionary, like the city managers in the later Civs that helped you deal with all the extra layers of complexity.  Even small things, like unchangeable hotkeys, weren't well thought out.  Where I go from frustrated to disappointed is unacceptably skimpy documentation.  There is no tech tree printout included, something basic to all RTS games and that was included in EE.  Moreover, neither is a civilization list along with their bonuses as well as any detailed information on unit and building statistics.  While all three are available piecemeal in the in-game tooltips feature, that doesn't make up for the fact that this is basic stuff that any RTS game should include.  (It's almost as if Sierra has made a deal with Prima to force you to buy the strategy guide.)  The lack of help in managing the new complexity means this game is far better suited to hard-core, experienced RTS players than those new to the genre.  Finally, graphics are only ok at best even though this requires fairly new equipment to run properly.

Don't get me wrong.  This is an entertaining game that will have you shocked that it's 3 in the morning when you just wanted to play for a couple of hours before bedtime.  Its just that if they'd spent a little more time polishing up playability this would leap from a good game to a classic.  Still, very much worth buying.",Reasonably entertaining but rather complex.

It is by far the best Mech game in a long time. There is definetly some ties in this game to other Armored core games and to Chromehounds but this game strikes a nice balance of the good stuff in those games. There is a steap learning curve but it is not to bad for Mech game fans. It just comes with the territory. The customization options are huge and the gameplay is suprisingly smooth and natural feeling. It didn't take me long at all to catch on to the controls. The only time I have noticed that can be a pain is when climbing buildings. Generally this works well but sometimes your mech will want to fly off in the other direction or you won't be high enough up on a structure to be able to launch off of it. Not game changing by any means but something you will notice and it will make you have to be more precise in your movement.

This is definitely a multiplayer game. All the story missions and side missions can be played together and for the competitive Conquest mode you will want as many people as you can get on your team. This will help in many aspects of the game. You can create your own team or join another team. I would not advise making your own if you are going to play solo. You can also loan out your services to other teams if you are just playing alone. There is an actual story to this game but I cant say that it really matters or that I have been able to follow along with it effectively but the missions involved in the story are pretty challenging and will put your team to the test. They are a lot of fun and rewarding. It is definitely a good build up to the competitive aspect of the game. Which will be the largest aspect of the game.

If you're playing this for story it's really bad in the terms of being very short, you can probably knock out the whole story mode in 2-4 hours. If you played Action u( for those who haven't played it it's hack and slash) this is kind of different from it, the combat feels a bit more weird in a bad way. There's way less monster spawns then Action U , about only 20-30 monsters would be in one spot at a time. Whenever you level up you get ability points to upgrade towards Attack, defense, technique (which gives you more combos). If you're getting this game for single player I wouldn't recommend it

Multiplayer:
Pretty much what the game was made for, kind of has a monster hunter feel without the whole climbing on bosses and stuff, there's a lot of unique bosses in multiplayer that you don't see in single player at all.

I also don't play online - my comments are just about the single player campaign, and more specifically, playing this game with the Move/Sharpshooter.

After being frustrated by several 'Sharpshooter compatible' games for PS3 that really seemed to treat the Move as an afterthought, I saw this game for cheap and decided to dust off my Sharpshooter and give it one last try.

I think the designers of this game did the best job of trying to make the Sharpshooter a success right 'out of the box'. I especially like the fact that at the default setting, the camera tracking approximates your movement - if you pan the Sharpshooter slowly, the camera moves slow too - not a perfect 1:1 match, but I couldn't get other games to do this no matter how much I fiddled with the optional settings. And speaking of optional settings, SOCOM4 offers a lot of tweakability for the Move, so I may experiment with those as well. There are also in game onscreen button prompts.

Bottom line, with just a little learning curve, SOCOM4 actually gets to be fun with the Sharpshooter pretty quick.

Anyway, I saw the Sharpshooter on clearance for well under $10 at a local big box store, and it's too bad - with more games like SOCOM4, the Move might have had a bigger following.",Worth getting if you have a Sharpshooter,1406246400,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

However, they get three stars on longevity and for being sort of a one-way street.

The first set I had started peeling up pretty quickly, and the top skin separated from the foam and started tearing away. I think that may be because I stretched them inadvertently trying to get them seated perfectly; I have a completely seat of the pants theory that the foam and top skin have different elasticities, so any stretching shears them apart over time. The second set I used have been more solid.

So that would have been four stars on longevity, except that when I pulled a set off to try out silicone controller grips, it left a godawful amount of adhesive behind. I got most of it off by picking it up with the sticky side of the grip I pulled off (that's the official recommendation from the manufacturer, iirc) but there's a faint tackiness left behind that I haven't managed to remove yet.

So where I'm left is that silicone controller grips are inferior products while on and forced me to change my charging dock, but they stay working forever and when something better comes along it'll be no drama. With SquidGrips, they could fail at any time, and pulling them off had better mean another set of SquidGrips or you'll be cleaning the controllers for awhile.

Were I a competitive gamer, I'd absolutely get these. They're better. For someone who's OK with good-enough, the silicone grips win out for being reliable.

One tip: do not put on the circular or side bump gel stickers. They do feel good in the hand to add a little contour, but the adhesive underneath can't handle the heat and sweat of your palms. You'll eventually start sliding the stickers around and they leave tacky glue behind everywhere.

Right away, lower your expectations, because this is the Wii and it obviously won't have the same graphics and physics engines of the PS3/360 versions. Now lower your expectations some more, because the graphics are pretty average by Wii standards. That out of the way, the Wii version features great implementation of Force powers through gesture-based controls, and you'll have a blast shoving enemies aside, blasting them with Force lightning, or holding them in the air and throwing a lightsaber through their chest. Lightsaber controls are also motion-based, and while it's more waggle than 1:1 precision, it works well with your Force powers and allow you to mow through the multiple enemies with ease. There is also a duel mode for the Wii version that lets you pick from classics characters, and it's amusing in short bursts.

What really hurts the game though are the same problems that plague most action games: The levels are linear, leading to some repetitive environments. The camera can also get seriously spastic at times, especially during boss segments where AT-STs and Rancors are bombarding you with hits. And for some strange reason you can't die, either - the game merely kicks you back to a previous checkpoint.

The first one died recently, but survived for years (as this was one of the original Wii balance boards). As with many Nintendo products, these devices are able to withstand some abuse. More important, however, is its effectiveness at actually weighing items, and it is very accurate. My family uses this as our primary scale, and weight management accessory. It works well in that regard, but it can be annoying having to turn on the TV, Wii U, and then start up Wii Fit U, all just to weigh yourself, which is why I've deducted a star. It would be nice if in the future it had a digital readout for quick weighs.

With regards to Wii Fit U, it's pretty okay, but honestly I mostly just use that program for weighing myself and tracking weight loss.

First the good:  the graphics aren't too bad -- they're just not like Quake.  The animals are very cute and when they have babies they're just adorable.  You have a number of additions to your zoo to decorate and entertain your audience.  Speaking of guests, that's probably one of the better points of the game.  In playing SimRollercoaster, I got very sick of how repetitious it was to send guards after delinquents almost every 5 minutes (meaning, it was just expected after awhile and got very boring.)  Here, the guests act more like guests.  You don't have mass riots break out (unless an animal escapes, obviously) and the most of you have to worry about is bathrooms and food stands.  Once that's in place, it's easier to concentrate on your exhibits rather than the fact that guest #1245 is pissed because there isn't any drink stand within 10 feet of him (although there's one 15 feet away.)  This isn't the case at all.  The guests roam around, take photos and buy stuff without vomiting or getting angry (like the system tells it to.)  It's a little more realistic and fun to play.
On the program itself, I was VERY surprised how well it loaded and how fast!  First thing it did was scan my system (quickly) to make sure I was compatible.  Usually with games, I have to run some type of diagnostic within the game disc, but this was different.  Also, it loaded within 10 seconds.  Most of the time, the games I buy take a full minute (such as the Sims or American McGee's Alice which takes a minutes inbetween boards)  I barely have time to grab a drink before it says: What do you want to do?
The downsides would be some of the glitches.  Very few, mind you, but they can be annoying.  I find that the keepers have a hard time walking -- period.  They sometimes walk in place for a second and my exhibits fill up with ""poo"" that they neglect to clean up right away.  But, I'm expecting a patch which I'm sure they'll put out sometime soon.  Otherwise, it runs just fine.  Makes sense, though if you think about it, here's a software company putting out a game that is directly compatible with their platform.  Who better to put out a game than a programming company?
All in all, cute game.  Very much an ""artsy"" type of Sim game where the player concentrates on the look and management of the park rather than the rides.  Pretty fun.","Cute, Fun and Easy to Control",1017014400,8,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

(I don't know what I was thinking, I just remembered Hearts was in the title) To my relief, I fell in love with this game. I played this game before the 1st two simply because I did not know they existed.  When I read in a magazine that SH 1 is one of the top 10 rare rpg's to own, I had to have it, along with SH 2.

SH 3 has a new lead character than the 1st two.  I know a lot of SH fans miss Yuri, but hey, this is a game, get over it.  The characters in this game are equally impressive and hold their own in the game.  I have to say that my favorite character would be Shania.  She had this ""like or not, I don't care attitude"" and her fusions are awsome.  Especially her La Sirene fusion.  She only has 4 spirits she can fuse with unlike Yuri, who had like 20.  I think that having just the 4 fusions is much better because it makes game play much easier to strategize.

Each character also had his/her own type weapon to control, like Johnny uses a knife, Shania uses her axes, Natan uses guns for his ""Gun Fu"".  As you advance in the game, you're able to purchase more powerful weapons and better armor.  However, do not buy for Frank, all his weapons are either found, or won.  Also, only buy for the characters you use the most.  Money in this game is not plentiful, unlike the first game.  Spend your money wisely!!!

I can't say this game is as good as the 2nd Sh, but at least Sh 3 tries to tie in the 1st two games in a very subtle way. If you have played SH 2, when you are in Times Square in SH 3, you'll notice a shop named Gepetto and Cornelia, sound familiar?  Some of you might have seen that the first play through, but I only recently noticed.  And the ring spirit, Aya, her ""daddy"" was the ring soul in Sh 2.  I guess they are just trying to keep some familiarity in all the games, sort of like FF did with the Chocobos.

The judgement ring is back and as always, it determines the success (or failure) of your attack, the ring spirit is back, and of course, Roger  Bacon is back. If you've never played a SH game and don't know what I'm talking about, not to worry, you really don't need to play the 1st two games to enjoy the third sh installment.

The story is rather straight forward, nothing too complicated, which for me was good.  And, if you get bored, go do some side quests, which there are many.  Like snap collecting.  Johnny takes pictures of all the monsters the team battles.  He can then trade those snaps to various snap collectors throughout the game in exchange for rare and even necessary items.  Be warned though, in order to open up the hardest side quest in the game, Johnny MUST take a picture of every monster.  He might not be able to trade them, but they are necessary.

The battle system is your basic turn based rpg, but the judgement ring is what makes this game different.  That is what makes or breaks your attack.

There is also something called Stellar Charts.  Equip your characters with a specific Stellar Chart, like Libra, and then you can equip certain stellars to that chart, like Cure.  Only Shania doesn't have a Stellar Chart because she had fusion forms.  You can then upgrade your stellar chart to make your attacks more powerful and even cost less MP to use.  Stellar Charts are a great way to customize your team.

There is so much more I can say about this game, but It's just easier to play.  If you want to try an awsome, yet a little out there, rgp, I truly recommend this game.",almost as good as its predecessor,1178236800,,,

Multiplayer campaign is much appreciated, but I hate the fact that you have to stick SO close to your partner. I got stuck and killed a number of times because of this. In future installments, they really should get rid of this.

The one thing that REALLY bothered me about this game was the ""realism."" It would be great if it really was realistic, and I'm surprised I haven't seen others comment on this. Lets talk about bullet drop folks....

Bullet drop is something that any sniper has to deal with. But most of the sniper rounds in WWII fired a .308 or larger round. So what you say? Sit tight... About the longest shot you will make in this game is 200 yards, MAYBE 240. I can tell you after many years of shooting in real life that at 200 yards bullet drop will be negligible with those types of rounds. But in the game you have to target so high above their heads to account for the drop that its just comical. 200 yards would BARELY change your point of aim. 500-1000 yards, then you are talking some more drastic adjustment, but 200 yards or less--no way. As I said, if it really were more realistic this would be a cool feature.

No seriously... this game provides a challenge, which makes it great!  the computer controlled cars will give you a hard time and push you as you advance though the game.  You can choose to work on the ""Racer"" or ""Cop"" portion of the story at any point and switch back and forth at will.  That certainly makes things interesting and helps keep the game from getting repetitive.

Possibly my favorite feature is that if you choose to play online, your friends can jump in with you at any point.  They can jump in and race against you or as cops and try and take you out!  Through multiple races I can see my friends top scores/times and try to beat them.

As far as the car selections, there are plenty... you unlock them quickly as well.  You do have spend speed points to get the cars once you unlock them but I have yet to run low on those.  Speed points come with completeing tasks and races.  Points seem to be plentiful.  But just because you have a fast car doesn't mean you will dominate... learning proper driving tactics and  using defensive upgrades such as mines and EMP charges will help get you to the finish line.

This is an immensely fun and engaging game of sneaking in the shadows, sniping enemy soldiers, and getting your butt blown off by sneaky APCs. It can be VERY difficult at times, and this is compounded by the inexcusable lack of an in game save feature. That's why I'm only giving it 4 stars. And because there is no multiplayer option.

GTA 3 was my introduction to the concept and it turned me off completely, I never even bothered with GTA Vice City or San Andreas. Saints Row seemed like a bad joke, a GTA rip-off tailor made strictly for lame urban gangsta thug wannabes. My idea of the typical Saints Row fan was basically Jesse from Breaking Bad. ""Yo yo yo wassup wear ma homiez at beeotch?"" Ugh. Well, as of last year I had somehow ended up playing a few other open world games (Assassins Creed, Red Dead Redemption, LA Noire) and discovered that I quite liked them after all. So I decided it was time to give GTA another chance. I dug out my old copy of GTA 3 and started a new game, and next thing I knew I had completed 3, VC, SA, and IV. I ended up really, really loving them. Right when I was at the height of my new found fandom, the first big official Saints Row The Third game play video hit, and I thought it looked pretty damn fun. I had no intention of buying or playing it, but just the fact that I thought it looked good at all was pretty mind blowing. I resisted for as long as I could, but about a month ago I decided that I had to play it. In my typical anal retentive MO, I insisted on playing Saints Row 1 and 2 first. I completed SR1 in a about a week, and it was pretty much what I expected: a soulless GTA San Andreas rip-off with the ""wackiness"" factor turned up to 11. In the end I had to admit it was actually pretty fun. Then I moved on to Saints Row 2.

Right out of the gate, I noticed major improvements over SR1, and I was damn impressed. SR1 was very rough and almost seemed unfinished in certain ways. SR2, on the other hand, is extremely polished with excellent production values. It's almost as if SR1 was a beta test, and SR2 is the fully realized version. I was glad to see that the main character was an actual *character* this time around, with plenty of a dialogue and a cool, cocky personality. (I always like it when a developer finally comes to the obvious realization that the 'silent protagonist' approach has outlived its usefulness and needs to die. See also: Visceral Games' Dead Space series.) When I play GTA, I generally focus on the missions and do them methodically one at a time. I've always had the impression that most GTA fans tend to not care too much for the missions and just go straight for the cheat codes so they can cause as much mayhem as possible. Saints Row basically caters to that sort of player and is designed such that there is a point to said mayhem. I have to admit, it's a lot of fun. And thankfully the ""YO YO YO WASSUUUUUUUUP **GGA"" gangsta thug crap is surprisingly toned down. It's closer to standard action flick fare, actually. That alone is a huge plus in my book. I know I'm setting the bar pretty low here. All in all, even with the boost in quality, Saints Row is still merely a GTA wannabe. If I had to chose, I'd take GTA IV over SR2 in a heartbeat.","Way less ""thuggy"" than expected",1327449600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

I was in the mood for a period thriller/horror game, like a detective game. I looked at the back cover and the graphics in the images looked good enough. Now, I want to say even back then when I played the game, the UI (user interface) was kind of stilted. The main character's name is Stranger (which was lame to me), and it was hard to control his movements. It seemed like the controls were lagging or something.

Anyway, aside from that, i did like the levels and really enjoyed the sound effects. There are I think 4 different missions in this. It's Urban Fantasy, so there are vampires, werewolves, zombies, and just different creatures. The game takes place from the 1920's through the early 1930's I think, so the weapons available are just things that would be available in that era, like a Tommy Gun or a stick of dynamite. While that's authentic to the era, I think the game could've gotten away with unique, handcrafted weapons like they have in Dead Rising 3, for example . In DR3, the main character knows how to gather old junk & craft his own weapons, which end up looking like things we've never seen before because he makes them just off the cuff. I would've loved to have seen something like that here in this game because frankly, I got sick of the Tommy Gun.

The gore wasn't that great either. Enemy bodies flew apart when blown up or shot with a shotgun, but they were dry with no blood really.

Any any event, that's all I really have to say about this for the moment. there's really no point in going into too much detail because I see how other reviewers have already done so. I think this game is a good price in 2015 for, say, $5 or something. but don't expect this 1999 game to stand up really in any way to 2015 NextGen games.

Definitely a co-op game made for you and your buddy on the couch. If you never played RE5, you should pick this up.
The gameplay is fun, it's more of an action type shooter, it doesn't have the scare factor that original resident evils had. I wish they would get back to that. But if you're needing a fun game to play with a friend, you should pick this up.
The story line is pretty good, you run into some old friends and it fills in some plots from previous games. It progresses like any other resident evil, you have a set path and you continue it killing zombies (or weird bug infected things that look like zombies).

I hate complex systems where I have to remember all these special combos in order to play the game.  That is NOT this game.

You can pickup this game in a few minutes.  The controls and simple and well organized (unlike the controls in Army of TWO or RB6).

The graphics are amazing.  Yes, there are glitches and places that you can't destroy everything.  But the ability to blow a wall out of a building to get at the enemy behind it awesome and very satisfying.

The single player game is a movie cut scene driven system.  It is well written for an FPS and keeps the player moving into the game very well.  You unlock new weapons in the game by finding them on dead enemies for the most part.

The online gameplay is amazing.  You start with a few weapons and unlock more through gameplay.  Your character has some RP elements to it by being able to spend your unlock points on things you like to do.  You can unlock sniper rifles if that is all you like to do for example rather than getting a new assault weapon.

Playing online has been a lot of fun for me.  I don't normally like FPS online play (too many kids with foul mouths yelling all the time).  But this has been a lot of fun to play and level your character.  You gain ranks and medals through online play.

VEHICLES!

You can also drive and shoot a lot of vehicles.  In particular I love the ability to jump on a tank someone else is driving and be their gunner.  If they jump out you can then take over and drive as well.  Helicopters are included as well (hard to fly, but cool).

FUN FUN FUN - Squad concept too

I have not had this much fun playing an FPS since the original Unreal series.  The maps are huge and leave a lot of room to run around.  You fight a series battles on each multiplayer map.  You can also choose to spawn with your squad, or to go back to the base.  This is a lot of fun when you have a good squad as you can look out for each other while playing.  There is a system between matches where you can rate your play with each squad mate and then you are paired up with people you like when they are online.  Makes it even more fun when you get to know people online and then play together with them.

Obviously, if you have not played Season one, you absolutely should play it for the amazing storytelling and tense emotional undulations, you will not regret it and it will be the best thirty dollars you can spend on a good narrative-driven video game right now.

400 days, quite simply touted as the companion episode to Season one and the prequel of sorts for Season two, isn't going to be that all-encompassing experience just like the first series of episodes, but more an attempt to bring the serial storytelling dynamic to a new place. Clementine, the main protagonist of the first season, isn't going to be here, and neither would any of the story arcs from previous episodes be featured here in any shape or form. This is a brand new story, and a fresh smorgasbord of characters appear in a story compressed like a single comic issue.

The analogy of a single comic issue applied here seems apparent when you first dig into the episode, with it featuring five different groups of characters who have no seeming relation to each other. Telltale has said it's going to feed into the main bulk of Season two, and while you wonder how that will pan out, a little testament to the efforts to create a polished serial story, that point isn't going to matter much once you work your way through these nuggets of gameplay.

They all have a story to tell, and of the heart-tugging variety too. It no doubt follows on the same dilemmas of living in a post-apocalyptic Zombie-infested world. To save someone means to sacrifice another, and to do something that looks right to you may have consequences on another front, but the gameplay looks improved here, like Telltale has learned many lessons from making adventure games thus far and applied them.

The improved gameplay would do well to satisfy the hunger anyone waiting for Season two may have. Lots of gunplay, lots of exploration yearns to show just what to expect from further episodes, you will cling onto these stories like a person clinging onto the vignettes in a themed short story collection. Curiosity will kill the cat, and you begin to feel invested in these people's lives.

Not all of them are put-together individuals but are fractured in their own vices and struggles, and Telltale is brilliant for creating a link between them, a clever ending and way of pointing towards the cloudy future. The episode is clever, although short, and if you want more Adventure game goodness from Telltale this is a no-brainer.

It is exactly what you think it is but with a few nuances thrown in like the first level when you avoid a fire ball spewing dragon. But this is a bit of window dressing because you will soon find yourself in the same modes battling a huge army, gradually unlocking the impressive 100 plus generals from Chinese and Japanese history and lore.  As you unlock them in Story Mode you can then open them up in other Musou modes... Sound familiar??  It is.
But if you were to buy one of these games as a staple I would suggest that this is the one.  It has a good feel to it and doesn't lock up too bad with 100s of enemies clustering around you.  Although it's clear that it's pushing it's bounderies as you sometimes find enemies appearing immediately around you as the action grows and the game pushes to fit all the action in.  I liked the varied characters and it was a good enough grind to get to each new stage and each new character unlock... (sometimes up to 5 characters unlocked after a level).  You can build them individually or as a group by spreading out distribution points (which are a bonus to the grinding experience you get).
As mentioned before the game is entirely voiced in Japanese/Chinese.  But this actually worked for me because the translations can be laughable and horribly out of place when you are getting your swerve on taking out pocket after pocket of troops.  A fun game but not a fresh idea.

It is a larger game than the previous and is a good co op experience if you and a friend want to have some mindless fun.

Graphics are amazingly realistic with loads of scenery and backgrounds. The main characters look fantastic and thier faces are very lifelike. Lip synching is a little off, but expressions are nicely done. The dark ""evil"" elements are great. Realy creepy and well done. Character animations are fluid and there are a few great ""horror based"" techniques used before and during combat. There is alot of walking around in the wilderness at night, but when the action starts it can be fast and furious. Two big hits from an ax murderer and your dead!

Combat is based around two styles. Light and guns. Your flashlight (which can be upgraded) is a vital part of your survival. You can choose from a few different types of guns, too. Including a revolver, shotguns and flare guns. They even give you flares and flash-bang grenades, too. If you are a fan of shooters this fills your basic ballistic needs. You can also drive a few cars in the town and found on the roads. They will not only help you get to your goals quicker, but it's great fun mowing down a ghoul once you've blinded him with your headlights! Only half the game is spent shooting. There are mostly tense exporations through the dark woods with a few nice puzzle solving elements thrown in just to keep you from getting bored of the trees...

Sound is fantastic with lots of ambient horror noises such as doors creaking open, ghostly wind blowing and demonic bellowing from your unseen enemies. The music is perfectly inspired by horror / suspense movies of the past. The violins shreeking so steadily are my favorite...

In fact I realy enjoyed the mixture of elements from a string of famous horror movies. Into the Mouth of Madness, Steven King, Hitchcock, The Birds, Poltergiest, Jason, Freddy, the list goes on...

It's mostly a suspense / horror survival story driven game which takes you from the start to the end, with tons of flashbacks to understand the who, the what and the why. I was a little disappointed by the end. The story weaves up and down and then all around. Honestly, I was left a little confused by the ending. Then (thankfully) I was able to download the prolog level ""The Signal"". I hoped to learn more about the story, only to finish it and learn it's ""To be continued"" ?

I think the 360 version discs hold less content than the BD PS3 versions, so DLC is simply a must for long 360 games... I'm glad mine came with the token code to download for ""free"".

The graphics in this game are top notch.  Great, large environments that really showcase what the XBox can do.  The sounds are amazing, the explosions are cool.  But, it's that third person perspective I don't like.  If you're running straight ahead, and someone is hiding on your left or right, you swing to shoot so your targeting rectical is on the target, but your body is still swinging around.  You will still be shooting in the other direction for a moment until your body catches up.  It's just not responsive enough.
What really drew me into Halo was the online part.  Me and a friend tried Brute Force on XBConnect.com using the System Link part, and just couldn't get it too work.  I still play AT LEAST 10 hours of Halo online per week, so I know it's set up correctly.  Why they came out with XBox Live I'll never know.  They still are not supporting a lot of their OWN games with it.  Even though we couldn't get it to work, they had a good idea with it.  You can have a person join up through System Link and play through the campaign.  I love that idea.  You can have up to 4 players playing through the story mode, one for each character.  We went ahead and played just against ourselves in a 1on 1, and it's still not Halo.  Small levels with no inspiration.  Players are not evenly matched so you know you won because you were the better shot, not just because you had more armor to begin with.

I've noticed that there seems to be a lot of negativity directed at this game, in these reviews and elsewhere (and this is no doubt going to continue). No, this game may not be perfect. But, being one of the seemingly few people who actually like it, I still find it to be very fun. I actually wish they would make MORE games like this one (although with some improvements)! Something you definitely should NOT expect of it is for it to be like the SmackDown games. It's a VERY different animal from those --- which is something that I'm not opposed to. You won't find (m)any wrestling games these days that AREN'T WWE-related, so I actually like that this one ISN'T! In fact, I believe this was the last-released wrestling game featuring ""real"" guys that wasn't related to ANY real-life wrestling company!
The BEST thing about it is the wrestler selection, which consists of a whopping 73 wrestlers  --- none of whom have to be ""unlocked"" (believe it or not!). Since this isn't a WWE game, you won't find any of the ""younger"" (e.g. John Cena) guys here. This is a LEGENDS Of Wrestling game (though it does have some guys whose inclusion is questionable)!  The guys here are (mostly, anyway) ""old school"" ones ---like Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage, Terry Funk, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Roddy Piper, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts,  etc. --- who first came around long before before professional wrestling became (thanks hugely to Vince McMahon) the huge, steaming pile of excrement that it is today (and before WWF turned into WWE). Most if not all of them are, as far as I know, either retired as wrestlers --- in most cases, for a LONG time now (though they may have put in the occasional ""special appearance"" or whatever) --- or deceased. Thus, people my age and over are probably more able to appreciate and enjoy this game than most younger people (especially kids),  who probably don't even know who the heck most of these guys are! (I do like the SmackDown GAMES, though, or most of them.) Most of my favorite ""old school"" guys are here --- including the Stinger! Yeah!! Ultimate Warrior is another one here who is to me especially welcome.
Of course, everyone has (and will have) complaints about the roster, as certain guys who could be considered ""legends"" (and I'm NOT talking about guys like Steve Austin or The Rock!) were for whatever reasons left out of the game, and, as I mentioned above, there are guys in the game who maybe (or definitely) don't really belong. Probably the most glaring omission, at least to my mind, is Ric Flair, whom I believe was in WWE when the game was made and whose contract was probably exclusive; if it hadn't been, then surely he would have been included. A couple (and JUST a couple) of the other guys who I think would have fit in here are Shawn Michaels and Lex Luger; as with Ric Flair, Shawn's WWE contract was probably exclusive, while I don't know how to explain Luger's absence (though I'm sure there are probably people who do know why he was left out). I don't really know what some of the guys who ARE on the game are doing here (though I'm not really opposed to them being here).
But still, the roster is probably the best I've ever seen; it's certainly better than the rosters on the SD games! (I don't think there's ever been, or will ever be, a wrestling game with a roster [or at least a roster of real-life guys] that completely satisfies everybody!) All of the guys here have four outfits to pick from, which is very cool, and I think most of the guys look pretty lifelike, maybe not exactly.
Of course, as impressive as the roster is, the wrestlers are not all that should be considered. I think the controls are pretty good, maybe not great. I don't have as much of a problem with them as so many other people do; from what they say, you'd think the game has the worst controls ever (some may actually say that!), but I beg to differ. The moves you perform depend on the position of your opponent rather than on different grapple types. There are really more moves that the wrestlers can do than it may seem like at first; you have to experiment, as the manual doesn't bother to go in-depth about the moves --- they ""let you discover some of the more sophisticated boom-boom by yourself."" (Lazy b*****ds!) Wouldn't it be easier to figure out ""boom-boom"" that WASN'T more ""sophisticated"" (by which I assume they mean ""complicated"")? There are undoubtedly moves (probably MANY of them) that I haven't found.
There are LOTS of modes and match types, with just about every type of match you can think of --- tag, cage, table, ladder, first blood, hard core, battle royale, etc.! It's even possible to have eight guys in the ring at once! (The last game before this one, as far as I know, in which this was possible was SmackDown: Just Bring It!)
I play the game at the lowest difficulty level (which I think it calls ""jobber""), and while I usually win, the computer usually does give me a challenge.
The game also has a create mode, which I usually love on wrestling games. I haven't messed with this game's Create mode very much yet, but eventually I'll probably be Creating away! (I'll definitely have to at least create an ""old"" Kane [from WWE] clone, even if Kane isn't truly a ""legend""!) You can even edit existing wrestlers (but I don't know if I'll do that)!
I do have some gripes, though. I wish this game had an option to just sit back and watch the computer battle it out with itself, and I think the controls maybe could have been better (though I don't really think they're ""bad""). There are also some other (mostly minor) quirks that I think should have been ironed out (I do find it a bit annoying that you often face AWAY from your opponent when you get up from a fall).
But so far, though, I haven't encountered any REALLY weird or major glitches in the game --- no freeze-ups or anything like that. (If what I've read is true --- and I hope it is --- freezing doesn't happen often.)
And while the game doesn't play at a very fast speed (especially not with a whole lot of guys in the ring), that doesn't bother me too much. I often find really fast-moving games hard to keep up with!
I certainly don't think the game is as bad as so many other people say. Yes, it does have flaws, but they aren't enough to totally ruin the game for me. I personally recommend this game, at least if you don't like the ""modern"" wrestling on TV (or PPV) or the ""newer"" wrestlers! Even though it's an older game (it came out in '04), I still think it's one of the best wrestling games, if not THE best wrestling game, that I've ever played, definitely the best nostalgic, old-school one! If you see it for cheap, then grab it, even if you have to get it ""used""!

4.0,False,"02 3, 2013",A281FJJ7JM6W0Z,B000JLL3UQ,PG,"Let me begin by saying that I love the Ace Attorney series! I found all five games and have been making my way through them. This is the second game in the series after Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. It retains a lot of the same gameplay mechanics. A murder occurs, you decide to help represent the defendant, you investigate the crime scene, and you go to court to defend your client. I believe there are only 4 cases, 1 less than the previous game. However, they do take a while and get longer as you progress. You'll still end up spending several hours on this game. What I love about this one is that it recycles other characters from the first game. You get to see familiar faces like Maya, Detective, Gumshoe, Lotta Hart, Will Powers, Mrs. Oldbag, and *spoiler alert* Miles Edgeworth. It really makes the game feel more cohesive and part of a story than just playing random cases that don't link together. This also means that you really should play the games in order. You won't understand references in this game without playing the original game first.

There are only two changes to the main formula. You get this new Psyche-lock thing. Basically, you get this relic and when someone is lying to you, a bunch of chains go up around them and you have to unlock their secret by presenting different evidence and talking to them. Once you break the locks, you get more information. The issue I have with this is that if you're wrong, it takes down a chunk of your ""health."" I say health because it's a green bar, and if it depletes the whole way, you stop the Psyche-lock. When in court, if your green bar runs out, you lose the case and have to go back to your last save. The Psyche-lock ends up just being annoying. It doesn't really serve a purpose. Why not just ask people questions and try to put the pieces together using testimonies and evidence like in the previous game? It seems like they were trying to throw something new into the gameplay mechanics, but it just ended up being a bit annoying. It's not terrible, but it doesn't really add anything.

The Psyche-lock wouldn't be so bad if it didn't affect your health bar so much. The health bar is also different from the other game. It used to be five exclamation points. In court, if you presented evidence incorrectly or did something wrong, you'd lose one. In this game, sometimes you end up losing larger chunks of the health by doing things incorrectly. Also, unlike the other game, the health bar doesn't regenerate when progressing to a new chapter of the case. So, if you screw up a Psyche-lock, you end up going into the case with no health, meaning that one mistake will make you lose the case! This is extremely frustrating! And the only way to replenish your health is to successfully complete a Psyche-lock, and it only gives you half your health bar back. This really is a huge flaw in this game. I much prefer the old way.

Despite that, it's a good game. If you liked the first Ace Attorney, you should definitely pick this one up.","Enjoyable, but Not as Good as the Original",1359849600,,,

This time around you get new powers and moves and there isn't nearly as much platforming to this game, which personally I found to be an improvement.

The game isn't overly long but the storyline is mostly cohesive and moves along at a steady pace.

So I was a little late playing this one, I just beat it 10 minutes ago, unlocking all skills, weapons, and subquests.  All in about 105 hours.  So I guess I guess I'd consider myself a hardcore RPG guy and this was one of the few FFs (along with 2 and 3) that I haven't got to yet.  And let me say I am quite pleased with a lot that this game offers, but I still couldn't stand some aspects of the game so let me break it down by story, gameplay, animations, and extras.

STORY.
If the game was rated solely on the story, 5 stars easily.  While I can't say it was the best of FF, it was just an overall solid intriguing story.  It DOES start extremely slow (and you might be like WTF is this), but the story picks up/ gets better as you progress.  Even the ending satisfied me.  One thing I didn't like was that it was a little excessive.  Sometimes you could press select to see a different thing happening at the time.  Usually these things were extremely insignificant, and it happens A LOT.

The characters were okay, but with their animation and choice of wardrobe, it was sometimes hard to take them seriously.  I will discuss that later, but I also kind of wish the characters were a little bit more mature.  I loved their personalities, but c'mon the princess is only 16, she's jail bait for crying out loud.  One other thing I didn't like about characters was that some of them didn't really have a major part in the story.  There could have been more to some of the characters in subquests, but not the case.

GAMEPLAY.
Another important aspect.  But I wasn't as fond of the gameplay.  What I didn't like was the leveling up and ""trance"".  For leveling up, it's so difficult to find good grinding spots, and it takes so long to level up.  Also, I finished the game at level 94 for Zidane and he only had about 6000 HP.

Another thing is how damage is conducted.  I obtained the summon Ark from the subquest toughest boss in the game which was extremely time consuming, and after a 5 minute cinematic presentation, it only causes about 7000 damage to regular enemies. Ugh, the Knights of the Round in FFVII would be laughing.

Trance was another issue.  Yea so it's like a limit break, okay, but you just barely ever get to use it.  Instead of activating trance whenever you want, it automatically happens, which sucks because the battle is usually over by the time you get it and the gauge starts over.  I didn't even get to use all the special attacks from Zidane's trance, in fact I think I only accessed it like three times.  That's a definite step back from FFVII's limit breaks or even (dare me) that of VIII.

ANIMATION/DESIGN.
What was square thinking with the design? This was the reason I never was drawn to playing it all those years.  The characters just looked too goofy or cartoonish.  To my expectation and dis, it WAS actually hard sometimes taking the story seriously with the cartoony animations (Zidane is a midget for crying out loud).

And what is with the choice of wardrobe.  The princess wears an orange jumpsuit, Steiner wears what looks like a Halloween knight's costume, and Kuja really ticked me off by wearing some weird outfit that looks like something a hooker would wear as some type of fetish thing.  Idk.. I really wish Square made a better effort to give the characters the animations they deserved. Look at Zidane in Dissidia, he's more life-like.

SUBQUESTS/EXTRAS.
Subquests were okay, but I think they could have been a lot better.  This is where I spent all my time on, including leveling up to beat optional bosses.  The chocobo mini game and treasure hunt, I found to be very fun.  But unfortunately that's pretty much all I can say.  Other subquests were very hard to find, very insignificant and not really part of the main story line.  So just overall definitely okay, but at the same time, definitely lacking.

BOTTOM LINE.
So Final Fantasy IX to be brief is a step above FFVIII but a step below FFIX.  Don't listen to people who say it's incredible.  It's not. It's a great experience but if you're used to the greats like IV, VII, X, then you'll be pleased with this, but not blown away.  For me, I had low expectations, and was quite surprised.  So try it out, it's a little lengthier than previous FFs, but you'll probably like it, but I'm telling you it does have some faults.",Exceeded my expectations,1310515200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I am a casual gamer, but I like some hardcore titles, and have a serious rig for the newer stuff.  I have played many of the top FPS games, but this was one of my first genuine squad-based games.

I found this ""new"" approach to a combat game very intriguing and fun.  While I usually prefer to be looking down the sights, I greatly enjoyed this style of play.  You command one of two squads of four soldiers, and can switch back and forth between them at will, choosing which position you want to lead from while directing the other squad.  It's all about learning and implementing proper flanking and cover tactics, using one squad to cover the other, or to create a diversion to draw the attention of the enemy while your squad moves to a better position.  When done well, it's a very rewarding feeling as one squad takes out the surprised threat from the side or rear.

I do agree with a couple of the complaints I've read in these reviews:  there should definitely be more grenades available for use, especially for the M203 (what soldier would only carry two rounds of ammo for this vital weapon?), and they should get resupplied when the squads restock their rifle ammo.  Also, you should be able to progress with a casualty or two, and get reinforcements at the beginning of the next mission--having to stop everything and carry a guy all the way back to  wherever the last resupply truck is gets old.  Having some way to render first aid on-site would've been nice.  Having a little more range on hand-thrown grenades would also be nice--the game forces you too close on tosses due to the very limited range.  These are all goals that would aid in the realism, as real troops would not have these limitations.

Those nits aside, this is a very fun game.  It looks quite good for the time of release, and there is a nice variety of terrain/obstacles to route your squads through.  Those looking for a good military game with a different feel from standard shooters would do well to try this one.  Sure, it's a little old, and I'm sure there are newer ones that do many things better, but you could do a heck of a lot worse (especially for the tiny price you'd pay for a copy these days).

In addition, you have to manage a party of three others, each with their own pages of settings and tactics. There's an element of ""tactical programming"" required for your party members, determining who and when they attack, which spells to use under which circumstances, how often to use healing items, etc. There are several sets of predefined tactics, but they may not be what you need. This task can be time-consuming and, frankly, a bit intimidating.

It's not like BioWare's legendary Neverwinter Nights, where you only had one companion to manage, with a tiny (but important) set of options. It's much, much more involved and minutely detailed.

His his debut back in the 1980's, he has really been recognized as both a hero and a felon on the video game market. Yet, the 1990's really brought Kong down to his knees. With the status of Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo, he was recognized as a more challenging player on the video game scene. Yet, Nintendo has constantly tried to recapture that Donkey magic several times, and most of the time it didn't work. Now, Nintendo really does have something that can beat him back to the top of the brass chain of video games.

Donkey Kong Jungle Beat for the Nintendo Gamecube, is a very unique kind of video game that has been developed. Riding the heels of those bongo drums from the Donkey Konga game, they are also used here to control D.K. through outrageous worlds and chapters to unlock. The unfortunate problem is that you have to buy the bongos with it, you can't play it on the regular controller. Still, the graphics are similar like to the 2-D atmosphere from Donkey Kong Country, with a little bit more of an appeal. The bongos for the game, which I just thought were a gimmick, are very easy to pick up and control our hero through many outrageous stages and challenges, including boss stages where they can be the case of you tossing fruit to the enemies, or a fist fight between you and the kongs. The gameplay was absolutely surprising and the enjoyment of the game really works very well.

All in all, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is really a great game for all gamers alike for the Nintendo Gamecube. This is a game where you really let your fingers rest, and you hands beat all the work.

It would be better to get the game after watching the movie since it gives so much of it away. The action is decent using force powers and your light saber to advance in skill from Jedi to Jedi Knight to Jedi Master. After each level is completed the experience you earn in the battle can be applied to advance your abilities such as throwing your lightsaber, force healing, critical attacks etc. I can use the force to move things and throw them at the enemy but this takes practice. As Anakin, Obiwan is constantly giving pointers like keeping up your guard or advice like looking for a power conduit. The game itself is you and a computer controled jedi either Anakin or Obiwan.

In fact, I played so much Halo, when it first came out, that I distinctly remember dreaming about it, a rare occurence for me.

The game was solid.  Single player was decently lengthed, if my memory serves me, at around 15 hours of gameplay.  The story was entertaining and filled with a variety of circumstances that really kept the player on the edge of suspense.  Multiplayer was a blast, if unbalanced, certain weapons being vastly overpowered.  And co-op.  The single player was long enough, epic enough, and fun enough to make the co-op experience probably one of the most satisfying gaming experiences of my life, and I've done a lot of gaming.

Halo 2 was more Halo 1 with minor updates, weapons balancing (and new weapons) for multiplayer, and new levels.  It also contained a short and frantic single player mode which was a bit of a let down.  There simply wasn't the concise simplicity and sense of awe inspired by the first Halo game.

Halo 3 is basically another Halo 2.

This may be due to the lack of originality (the plot and characters had already been set). but I think it is mostly in the details.  The first game had a singular vision.  It persented you on a incomprehensibly huge ring-world with glorious sprawling levels and mind boggling visuals.  Gameplay was tight and exacting, each conflict an epic struggle with a new twist; from battling through a giant convenant ship to save your captain, to spelunking deep into an island to retrieve a map of the Halo.  Halo 2 completely lacks this consistency, cuts back on the level lengths, and flits between characters and situations.  I honestly can't recall the plot of Halo 2 AT ALL, and I've played it three or four times.  The battles were also so frequent, and with such similar enemies, that I grew bored with ease.

Halo 3 suffers from all the failures of Halo 2.  It is short, frantic, and inconsistent.  There are only a few types of enemies in the entire game, and you will fight them a lot.  This culiminates with an absolutely endless gauntlet of Flood slaughter through a disturbingly labrynthine Flood Encrusted vessel.  The gauntlet itself is annoying enough, but the similarity of all the monsters being faught is maddening.
Despite all this, Halo 3 does diverge a bit from the foibles of its little brother, and I want to take a moment to applaud it for this.  Halo 3 returns to a Halo for the last few levels of the game, and for a moment I felt as if I was playing Halo 1 again.  The levels again had an epic feel.  A variety of enemies encountered me at every turn.  I was presented with a mix of vehicle use and on-foot combat.  Also, for these brief few moments I know what the heck is going on.  And the end.  Pure Halo 1.  True, it might even be copying Halo 1 lick for lick, but the ride is amazing, and in many ways justified my time playing the game.

Should you buy this game?  If you are already a fan of the series, definitely.  The gameplay is more of what you have grown to know and love, and the story does conclude, if a bit open-endedly.  It's certainly a good game, by almost any standards.  The multiplayer, which I have played a fair bit, is Halo 2 rehashed.  If you are looking for a standalone good FPS don't bother.  You can't follow the story unless you have played the first two, and even so I had trouble following where and why things were happening.  Also, if you are looking for pure single player you will be saddly disappointed at the length.  I think I beat it in 7 or so hours on Heroic (up one difficulty from normal).  In this sense Halo 3 is a truely multiplayer game with brief moments of multiplayer brilliance.  I give it a 8/10.  In comparison I give Halo 2 an 8/10 and Halo 1 a 9.5/10.  (I'd put Halo 3 above Halo 2 on my must have list, however).

Halo 3 had its moments, but it is mostly just an upgrade to an already strong franchise.

The game is the most expensive one out there right now for Playstation 2 owners, that some are just hoping it drops so they can also afford to rock out loud.

All in all, what I saw in Guitar Hero I really was amazed. This is really a good game for PS2 owners, and I definitely suggest this as a add-on to your video game collection. If you have a need to rock out loud, rock it to this great game.

I don't think I've used a keyboard with such a great tactile feel and satisfying audible feedback since my original IBM AT keyboard. The amount of force required to type is perfectly balanced, for me.  I can rest my hands on the keys without accidental strokes.  Previous membrane keyboards felt like they required more force to register strokes, so typing on the G610 feels effortless.
The backlighting makes it easier to use in low light setting.  Although the board has a button that allows you to change brightness of the backlighting, the default setting is to have the keys light up in a 'wave'.  Since the human eye is attracted to motion, I find it very distracting to have a wave of light travel across my keyboard. I wish the default setting was to have a constant backlighting, so this is where my rating falls to 4 stars.  I'd prefer to not install more software on my PC, but I was forced to install Logitech's software to control the backlighting.
Another minor complaint is the placement of the caps lock/scroll lock/num lock indicator lights.  To make room for media control buttons, the indicator lights were moved to the top middle of the board, where it is not so intuitive to figure out which light is which.  There are labels etched under each light, but they are unreadable, even in decent lighting levels.

The camera also works as a targeting system which is something not many other games have so it may take a while to get used to it. And the game can be completed in a few days. But enough downsides, let me mention the good things about this game.

 Storyline: 10/10

 This game has a great storyline. It's dark, a bit angsty, and full of spy action. But my favortite thing about the storyline is how it links to the many wars in which the U.S. has fought. Especially WWI, WWII, and the Cold War. You'll see what I mean.

 Graphics: 8/10

 Not the best graphics in the world, but the facial features in this game are the best part in this game's graphics. Wrinkles, scars, and bruises are shown perfectly during close-ups.

 Gameplay: 9/10

 Only thing that keeps me from giving the gameplay a 10 is the hard-to-get-used-to camera. It's hard to explain why it's so complicated, you just have to see it for yourself to know what I mean. But besides the camera which also works as a targeting system, the gameplay is awesome. So many(gory)ways to eliminate enemies are available in this game. You can burn them to the crisp(Pyrokinesis), crush them to the bone(Telekinesis), and/or beat them to the pulp(hand-to-hand).

 Camera: 9/10

 As I've mentioned twice before, it's a bit hard to get used to it at first. But once you do, you can master your powers. I can't blame them for using this camera though, I can't come up with a better way to use your powers without that type of camera.

 Controls: 10/10

 Midway chose wisely in which buttons to use for which powers. Before this game came out; I was curious on how you would manage so many powers and I thought I would forget which button was for which power. But Midway are geniuses and they chose perfectly. It's impossible to forget which button is for which power in this game.

 The following is the list, definitions, and abbreviations of/for the Psi powers in the game in the order you get them:

 Telekinesis(TK): The ability to lift and throw objects or people with Psi powers.

 Remote Viewing(RV): The ability to exit the mind from the body and see ahead of you without being detected.

 Mind Drain(MD): The ability to drain other people's Psi energy to recover your own.

 Mind Control(MC): The ability to exit the mind from the body and make the mind go inside someone else's body and control that body.

 Pyrokinesis(PK): The ability to create fire with Psi powers.

 Aura View(AV): The ability to see hidden things to the naked eye such as ancient writing, washed stains, and invisible writing with Psi powers.

 Now I'll give you a summary of the story:

 During the 20th century, many governments around the world investigated the possibility of using paranormal abilities, such as Telekinesis and Clairvoyance, to aid in their espionage programs. Before long, the largest nations were successful in establishing Psi operations. But, in the last years of the millenium, and with the Cold War over, many of these operations lost funding and credibility.

 The American Psi program known as Project Mindgate came under intense scrutiny when an overzealous General overstepped his bounds and used his men for unsanctioned actions. Congressional hearings followed as an outraged public lamented over tax dollars spent on ""phsychics and witch doctors."" The government released false stories to hide the truth about the immense power of Psi, publicly shutting down Project Mindgate but quietly continuing a top-secret Psi agency.

 The General went underground rather than face a war crimes tribunal. Seeking power and revenge, he began recruiting disenfranchised Psi agents from all over the world.

 These abandoned, forgotten men and women were once revered amongst the highest powers of world nations. Banding together, they no longer saw the world in terms of nation against nation.

 Instead, it was Psychics vs. ""Mundanes"", those with Psi abilities wanting control over the everyday common man. This military cabal began a secret war against the nations of the world, creating a front organization called the Movement to hide their activities and build their army.

 During a raid on a vital oil refinery guarded by UN anti-terrorist troops, a squad of UN soldiers is taken prisoner by the Movement. You will assume the role of one of these men, Nick Scryer.

 Nick finds himself locked away in a secret base deep within a former Soviet missile silo where terrorists are performing unusual experiments on their prisoners. Soon a beautiful woman named Sara approaches his cell and helps him to escape. She explains that she's a double agent working for the US government and has infiltrated the terrorist organization. The two begin an adventure to uncover the Movement's hidden agenda and stop them at all costs.

 In order to plant an agent into the Movement, Mindgate has masked Nick with some facial reconstruction and used advanced brainwashing techniques to suppress his real memories. This ""memory wipe"" procedure will allow him to pass through the Movement's powerful Psi detection equipment. Once inside, Sara helps Nick regain his memories and immense powers, revealing his past through vivid flashbacks, allowing him to complete his mission as a Mindgate agent.

 Nick and Sara infiltrate the Movement's secret bases around the world. They discover that at the center of this secret Psi war is a mystery even more sinister and strange: An ancient artifact known as the Monolith. What is its purpose and why is it so important to the outcome of this most deadly of all spy games? Nick is determined to find out as he fights the General's evil plan, cofnronts his past, and uncovers a mystery as old as time.

4.0,False,"09 13, 2005",A3UIHZ3IOOZXXT,B00004SVYR,Zzonkmiles,"Dragon Warrior 2 expanded on the original Dragon Warrior in several ways.  The world map was four times larger, you could enlist the services of two additional warriors, the storyline was more complex, and the enemies could attack you in larger and more dangerous groups.

Having been released during the middle of the NES's lifespan, one should not expect to find dazzling graphics and masterful soundtracks here.  However, the graphics are generally easy enough to understand and serve their purpose even though they are tile-based and generally bland, especially in the dungeons--most of which look exactly alike.  The music score is decent, particularly the dungeon and castle music scores.  The dungeon music can actually be a bit frightening, especially since the enemies themselves are so deadly.

Dragon Warrior 2 is quite challenging, as there are many places to explore.  The game starts off quite linear at first, but once you rescue the Princess of Moonbrooke and get the ship, the game opens up considerably.  There's also a reasonable variety of weapons, armor, and magic spells available to you to help you defeat the enemies.

However, this game has several flaws:

1.  Difficulty.  Even to this date, Dragon Warrior 2 is one of the hardest RPGs in existence.  In this game, literally almost every battle has the potential to be your last one.  The enemies will notoriously gang up on a weakened character.  And the enemy groups are also often much stronger than you are.  Some enemies can drain half of your MP in one attack.  Other enemies are too strong to be located in some dungeons (such as Dragon Flies in the tower with the Water Crest).  Also, the dungeons are very, very difficult.  The Cave to Rhone is easily among the most dangerous dungeons in any RPG.  There are invisible holes, snaking passages, obscured rooms, and corridors that repeat themselves, so you would be wise to make a detailed map of the more difficult areas.

2.  Weak play control.  The menu screen was simplified from its original version in Dragon Warrior 1, but it is still not so easy to navigate.  Buying, selling, and trading items is also quite difficult because you have to remember who has what beforehand.  Being able to view your item list more easily while you shop would have been nice.  Also, the Return spell is a bit of a pain to use since it warps you back to the last place you saved, even though that might not be the village or castle you want to return to.

3.  Not enough space.  Even though you have three characters who can carry up to eight items a piece, you will often find yourself throwing items away or abandoning treasure chests because you simply don't have the room.  In addition to the characters' regular weapons and armor, there are four keys that open four different types of doors.  These keys cannot be thrown away, so they must sit in your inventory taking valuable space even if you don't use them.  You also might want to equip a Dragon's Bane on every warrior to reduce the effectiveness of the enemies' spells.  So that's another space gone.  This lack of space further contributes to the game's difficulty because it means you have less room for restorative items.

Having said that, this game is reasonably fun to play.  The level curve is rather steep, so this game should appeal to RPG veterans.  The storyline is reasonably engaging and there's even a bit of humor in the dialogues you can have with the townspeople.  Unfortunately, Dragon Warrior 2 has not aged well, as it was really just a good game for its time.  A lot of DW2's weaknesses have been fixed in later RPGs, so the casual RPG player may wish to skip over this one.  However, you can't really go wrong with playing this game, as it's actually a pretty good game.  Just remember that it's a bit on the difficult side, so be prepared.","A good game for its era, but very difficult",1126569600,15,,
4.0,False,"06 18, 2009",A2A14RBCFGMV7L,B000U8DTW8,Mali,"This is a GREAT game! We started the game Monday night and finished it last night (Wednesday). It's a hard game to stop playing and I loved the clever mysteries within the story. Tha narration is also well done ,creepy, and intriguing. There is absolutely NO need fo a strategy guide or a walkthrough if you have enough intelligence and/or patience for puzzles. Clues are all over the house for codes & you can't get stuck if you talk to everyone and explore all areas. Your actions trigger the next actions. Search an area, talk to everyone, then search again. Easy enough. The only point we got stuck at was the second to last chapter when we couldn't find one of the guests. 10 minutes later we talked to everyone in a different order and were feeling stupid for our oversight.
I DO NOT recommend this game for inexperienced, casual, or impatient gamers however! Like Silent Hill & Resident Evil, advancing depends on figuring out how to put items together, where to use them, and who to talk to -but on an easier scale puzzle-wise. The controls are easy to use with the Wii remote and includes things like turning doorknobs and digging with a shovel, which adds to the interactive intrigue of the game.
It is also made by The Adventure Company who are known for their excellent puzzle/mystery games. If you can't sit still for a few hours to read a book, you would probably be better off playing Super Smash Bros or something similar. Also, it is impossible to die playing this game so you can really enjoy the story unraveling. To those who love only survival horror with constant enemies and battling crazy zombie/demons, you may be bored. I love many survival horror games but find an overdose of enemies around every corner to be distracting...
A final warning to people familiar with the book -the ending has been changed to suit a video game and to insert a playable character, but at the end you are treated to the end of the original story as a bonus in the form of a voice-over letter.

My experiences with early video-gaming were smacking my TV on the top, smacking the NES, and blowing hard in the cartridges.

Then one Christmas my uncle and aunt gave me a Game Gear.

The first thing I saw when I opened it up was the image of Batman on the Batman Returns cover. At first I thought it was a VHS copy of my favorite Batman film, and I was ecstatic. But the wrapping surrounded a much larger box, so I continued to open it. Finally, as the wrapping lay ripped apart near my feet, I held what was a copy of Batman Returns for the Game Gear taped to a purple and black box underneath. I removed the game and saw the main meat of my gift: Sega's answer to the Game Boy.

But at the time I had no idea what it was. I'd heard of the Game Boy but never the Game Gear. So my reaction was a mixture of both excitement and confusion. Like I said, I didn't play video games much until then, so I wasn't sure what I had in store for me.
Little did I know this would be my sole world of digital entertainment until I purchased my PlayStation (with my own money, mind you) years later.

I carried this thing everywhere. It wasn't long till I figured out that this thing is nearly useless if you use just batteries, and my parents got sick of buying new ones (the rechargeable technology we have today was nearly non-existent back then). Shortly thereafter I purchased an AC adapter and that's what I used all the time to power my portable machine. It never phased me after that that the Game Gear wasn't as portable anymore; I just waited until I was home or at a relative's before busting out some Sonic et al.

The colored, backlit screen made me feel superior to Game Boy owners, though I secretly lusted to play Super Mario Land and, eventually, Pokmon every once in a while. But my time for that would come much later.

Back in the day, the screen was amazing, but I've noticed that, after playing it recently after so many years of it being in the closet, Sega's first handheld has a severe white wash to their colors. Even playing with the contrast wheel will prove difficult to find that perfect angle. The Game Gear is notorious for having bad capacitors, so they'll need to be replaced eventually. Mine has been, and the screen is back to new, but there's just no going around that white wash.
The Game Gear is a great machine, but if you haven't played one back in the day and are used to today's backlit-screen technology you will be severely disappointed. Emulating would probably be your best bet.

The volume on mine is unfortunately non-existent, even after replacing the capacitor, but the headphones work just fine.

Out of all the handhelds I own, from the Game Gear and Game Boy Color to the 3DS XL, I find the Game Gear to be the most comfortable to hold without any grip attachments. It's large--almost the size of a small tablet--but it's very comfortable for adult hands. The buttons are very responsive, though the d-pad on mine has gotten sort of sticky on the bottom over the years. I may address that in the future.

I burned many hours playing Sonic Triple Trouble, MMPR (and the sequel), and Jurassic Park. I own many other carts, but those are my favorites. But would I recommend purchasing a Game Gear?

No.
The Game Gear is amazing, and I love mine and all the games I own, but you wouldn't be missing out on much if you never got around to buying one with working capacitors. The games are dirt cheap, but the only ones I'd recommend playing are Sonic Triple Trouble and both MMPR fighting games. The former is the only exclusive Sonic game on the Game Gear, and the Power Rangers games are some of my favorite portable fighting games.",My introduction to gaming.,1402272000,,,

1. Obviously, the G930 has wireless and the G35 does not. You can also charge the G930 while listening to it, and vice-versa. The G35 has a pretty long cord as well so I don't think the length will be an issue.

2. Software. The G930 software looks a little nicer than the G35 software, and it has some more audio customization options, which I don't know how to use since I'm not an audiophile. Overall, the G930's software is a little cleaner looking and slightly more in depth.

3. Build quality. The G930 feels A LOT nicer than the G35. The G35 has a really loose plasticy feel to it. I was surprised when I opened up the box today and the quality was different than the G930. The G930 feels much more solid and the quality is a lot nicer. The G35 does look cooler (in my opinion) but it has a more plastic feel to it than the G930.

4. The weight. The G930 is heavier than the G35, for obvious reasons, but it isn't that big of a deal.

5. The sound. Both of them sound exactly the same. I don't hear anything differently at all. The sound really isn't THAT great compared to what you get from a dedicated sound card, but you will think the sound quality is amazing if you don't have much experience with audio products. I can tell you right now that a pair of AD700/HD555's and an ASUS Xonar DG are a MUCH better choice for listening to music and for gaming (thanks a lot to OCN for recommending these to me).

Overall, I think the G35 is a better set than the G930. My G930 disconnected every 2-3 minutes for a couple seconds. I swapped it out, and I had the same issue. The issue is from having soo many 2.4GHz products in your house. In my case, there are 2 routers in my house (one close to me) and a phone in my room. These things interfere with the G930. I would recommend the G35 even though it has a cord, just because of this reason. It can get pretty annoying while talking on Skype or gaming! Although, I did have a lot of fun with the wireless of the G930. I used to talk with my friends on skype while going to get a glass of water or going outside to check the mail :)",Logitech G35 vs Logitech G930,1306800000,2,,

Let's get the negative out of the way first: all is not perfect... in addition to it's choose your own adventure gameplay, the game also features a host of bugs.  Most of these issues aren't too bad; In my adventures, I've come across nothing game-stopping.  None of the issues I've encountered so far have have distracted from the overall experience.

But here's the thing... I don't think any of them ever will.

Even despite it's problems, Fable II is still a fantasic game.  The world of Albion has so much personality and character that it continues to draw me back in no matter what the issue.  Personally, the main story takes a back seat to everything else you can do.  And to top it off, the real icing on the cake is that you can customize your character however you like, from powers to personality to appearance.

Valenzona,"Im happy to report everything positive from the first Theatrhythm game was enhanced in Curtain Call and many shortcomings were improved upon (read my review of the first game for more info). First off: only buy this game if you are a huge fan of Final Fantasy or music games in general. Second off: if you are a huge FF junkie, should you buy a 3DS just to play this? Not by itself, but if there are other 3DS games out there youve wanted to play, Curtain Call could be the final nudge you need. Third, here are some points on what was and wasn't improved upon:

- Repetition is still there, but not nearly as bad as it was. The dark note system received an overhaul and is now quest mode. Previously you would grind the same two songs repeatedly for either XP or a certain color of crystal shard. Quest mode gives you more songs and better rewards. Plus you always get a new quest when you beat one.

- Less crystal shards required to unlock characters. In the first game, every character took 8 shards to unlock and youd never get more than one shard at a time. In Curtain Call, some require as few as 4 shards to unlock and you can choose between 4-5 different characters per shard color! You also often get several shards at a time for quest and rhythmia collection rewards.

- Deep cuts. There are tons of songs and characters before you think about DLC. Even FF Mystic Quest and Advent Children are included! There are a huge amount of tracks for the game to insert into the quests which, again, reduces the repetition.

- More freedom with how to play. You can choose most tracks right off the bat and can play them one at a time rather than having to play three in a row from a certain game.

- There are different input methods. I don't remember this being an option in the first game. Instead of having to use the stylus for everything, you can also incorporate buttons, the circle pad, or even use a one-handed mode. Good stuff.

- No cut-off tracks. A few songs from the first game skipped cool intro parts, like FFXs Battle With Seymour or FFVIs Dancing Mad. Not the case in the sequel. The full songs are here for your enjoyment, or at least I have not encountered any cut offs yet.

- Online play is killer. Yes, you can play people head-to-head through the internets, not just locally via wifi. This is a really cool option. Even if you get your butt handed to you by some dude in Japan who has maxed all his characters and can play each song with his eyes closed, you still exchange the streetpass profi-cards which are great because you can attach quest maps to them. If you have a particularly good map, you can share it with others. The only problem you may have is finding someone online at the same time as you who wants to play. It may require some waiting.

- More uses for the collecta cards. They can now be used to improve your character stats. Still haven't played with this much, but its neat.

- There is DLC available, but you don't feel like Squeenix cut corners on main game content in order to bilk you. The first game kinda felt like that as it left out some awesome tracks.

Bottom line is this is that Curtain Call is a must-play game for Final Fantasy fans. You can safely skip the first game.",Great improvement on the original,1418860800,16,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},
4.0,False,"10 6, 2008",A3ALLLC2FXZ134,B00149IL9I,Halicon5,"When I first heard about this game, I really didn't know what to think of it, but previews and videos convinced me to make the plunge.  I'll start by saying that de Blob is one of the most unique platformer titles available on any console.  This game is what you would expect if Super Mario Sunshine, Okami, Jet Grind Radio and Katamari Damacy had a love-child together and raised it in a jazz club populated with hippie jelly beans.  You run around the different black-and-white levels playing Blob, who happens to be a blob of paint.  Similar to Okami, the more you play, the more the world around you changes.  As you touch things such as buildings or trees they become drenched in paint matching your current color and vibrant patterns.  There are puzzles along with traditional platform challenges.  It doesn't do anything particularly new, but the combinations of gameplay elements found within are well thought out and very engaging when the paint-the-world aspect comes into play.

Graphically, the game is very crisp and smooth.  Musically the game annoys me, but I'm not personally into jazz-club style tunes, so I am a little biased.  For a platformer, I'm really impressed with the camera and I rarely have to fight with the controls to see what I want to see.  Blob controls fairly well, but it took me a bit to get used to the movement mechanics, especially the jumping.  You score points by painting the world around you and you'll gain bonus multipliers if you score combos without touching the ground between objects.  It took me a good couple of hours before I could get the hang of creating combos, wall-sliding, and wall jumping, but it was all very rewarding once I crossed that hurdle.  I just wish that Blob moved a little faster and the wall jumping was a bit more predictable.

The Good
++> Huge levels to explore, although they tend to be similar.
++> An Okami-like change-the-world gameplay mechanic sits at the core of the game.
++> Simple but vibrant graphics with smooth gameplay.
++> Great presentation and style, even if it is very jazz-heavy.
++> Clever challenges and puzzle designs
++> Very forgiving gameplay with a steady increase in difficulty.
++> This game is a completionists dream-come-true with challenges and rewards for every level.
++> Good camera control
++> The audio controls let you reduce the volume of the vile easy-listening jazz.

The Bad
--> Too much jazz.
--> Adults will probably care nothing for the storyline, but children will probably enjoy it.
--> I really want to see more challenges and puzzles.  There just aren't enough.
--> Blob could move faster... but apparently he chooses not to.
--> Jumping mechanics are a bit unpredictable
--> Completionists might be overwhelmed with the amount of stuff to accomplish.

Overall, I am really enjoying this game.  I haven't tried any of the multi-player yet.  The single player though is very strong and it looks to be a fairly long game.  Fans of platformers should definitely consider picking this game up.",A deceptively decent game.,1223251200,15,,

4.0,False,"08 18, 2008",AHZXXRZHFMSO2,B000VJRU44,Joe M,"First things first: I'm a PC game player almost exclusively. I haven't owned a console and put it to serious use since, well, the Atari 2600. I bought the Wii for two reasons: to get my wife into gaming and for the Wii Fit. So far, the Wii Fit has been a very satisfying success.

There are four main sections to the game: yoga, strength training, aerobics, and balance games. Yoga and strength training are the most legitimate exercises, with fifteen different types of exercise each. These two groups have a personal trainer (male or female) explaining and demonstrating the moves for you before letting you do them yourself. The aerobics and balance sections are more game-like, although the aerobics activities definitely get your heart pumping and the sweat flowing. These two sections also make heavy use of the Mii characters, which is entertaining in and of itself.  The balance games are the most entertaining and accessible, but probably the least likely to get you in shape.

You begin with only a handful of exercises and activities available, but as you start putting time into working out, you unlock more positions and moves. It's a great motivator, since you'll want to keep working out to see what else is available. The activities seem to increase in difficulty and intensity at a nice steady pace, as you unlock more challenging moves and the option to do more reps for previously opened ones.

The balance board peripheral is able to sense how well you're balanced for all the activities, and is remarkably sensitive. The designers did a great job thinking out how all the activities would work out in practice, and the game can tell a lot about how you're doing based on your center of gravity. In fact, on one occasion, I was doing something, lost my balance, and had to put my foot on the ground to regain it. The game immediately called me out: ""You put your leg down, didn't you?"" I had to chuckle at that. It's great to be able to get continuous feedback about how you're doing, instead of doing it alone and hoping you've got it right.

As many have said, you can cheat on most of the activities if you want to, but if you are, you're a pretty pathetic person, and wasting your time and money pointlessly.

The graphics in the yoga and strength training sections are pretty basic, but more than sufficient to understand the poses and exercises. The aerobics and balance section have pretty whimsical graphics, but they look nice as well.

The sound is decent, with verbal instruction for the yoga and strength portions, and silly and catchy tunes for the aerobics and balance sections.

It is true, the Wii Fit system isn't perfect, since you can't program a series of activities continuously, and must instead select them one by one, stopping in between each to move on to the next. Still, the delays are minimal, and you can do quite well if you're focused.

One of the best parts of the entire system is the ability to do daily body tests, which tell you how much you weigh, your BMI, and your Wii Fit age. The most useful part of this is the graph, which shows your progress towards goals of your choosing. I'm always making goals like this, and wanting to keep track, but being able to have it up on a TV screen, all neat and organized, motivates me like nothing else. The fact that you can also record out-of-game activities on your exercise chart is also great motivation to actually DO other physical fitness activities outside of the game. I have been on and off into yoga for almost a decade, and this provides great motivation to do it and add the time to my daily workout chart. This might not motivate everyone, but for a guy who's been keeping virtual score for decades, this is the just the thing.

Overall, the Wii Fit is as useful as you make it. If you're just looking to goof off, you can certainly do that, but if you're serious, this will definitely be a key component of your exercise regime. I will make one other note. As someone with a lot of experience with yoga, I found most the yoga and strength training exercises familiar, and understood what they were trying to achieve. For someone with little or no experience in those areas, it might be well advised to look some things up online to familiarize yourself with them before diving into this ""game."" Still, I can heartily recommend the Wii Fit for anyone that has a strong desire to get into shape.","By tricking you into exercising to get points and fill graphs, Wii Fit keeps technophile nerds motivated and organized.",1219017600,,,

The graphics here are pretty amazing, especially if you remember the previous Max Payne games. The bullet time third person gun-play can be insanely fun, but I really don't think it's enough to sell the entire game. I love that every slow jump is controlled by you, leading to either hilarious failures or glorious successes when you kill everyone in your jump. However, the fact that there really aren't any ways to modify the bullet-time jumps, leads to them eventually being very repetitive and boring. I would love different jumps, like maybe a slide, or something else to add a different flavor to the combat. Also, this game relies a lot more on cover based shooting if you want to survive, but it is a little different from the normal Gears of War style. I must say that the AI is pretty intelligent. However it becomes annoying when they stay hidden and invulnerable behind cover for very long periods of time, yet you will be shot/killed many times when you're shooting from cover or even hiding behind it. My other biggest problem with the combat is that it feels a little wooden at times, and Max is like an old man getting up and moving around (when not in bullet-time). After a dive, you are completely screwed if any of your enemies are alive while you slowly come to your feet. Related to this, if you are ""killed"" when you have painkillers you will automatically enter bullet-time with a chance to kill the person who shot you. There are multiple problems here, where sometimes the enemy can't be shot where they are, but the biggest problem is that if you succeed no matter where you were before you wake up lying on the ground. With how long Max takes to get up combined with the fact that you cannot go right into cover, you have to stand up fully before you regain control, I usually took so much damage that I was right again in danger of dying. It was also incredibly annoying with how much damage the enemies can take, as over and over I would unload into them and turn to continue the fight and then be killed by the guys I thought I'd finished. Sometimes the characters would fall down and get back up, but most of the time they would just absorb multiple bursts from an assault rifle and not flinch.

Now on to other parts of the game. The campaign is relatively long, but it is completely linear with no possible variation (and no reason to replay it) with multiple jumps along the timeline. It was kind of nice to have different versions of Max, but since they didn't control any differently they just made the story more convoluted. I think I would have liked to play the game missions in order, it wouldn't have improved the story itself at all, but I think it could have helped a little bit. The story is idiotic, there's a gigantic plot hole I won't spoil as it's supposed to be the big twist, but it really makes the whole set up of the story incomprehensible. I also wish Max wasn't such a bitchy whiner in this game, he's always bashing himself without realizing all of the bad ass things he'd done (I mean I killed thousands of paramilitary forces/gangsters/dirty police while flying through the air!). I think the biggest problem with the story is that there's no higher purpose for what you're aiming to do. There are parts where it's kind of a rescue the princess deal, but the princess isn't likeable and will always die anyway. Then there's a bit of revenge is best served cold storyline, but the villains are all interchangeable and the game never gave you a chance to like the people you're avenging. I just didn't care about the story other than wanting to kill everyone (which they prevented you from doing in the very end, even though the guy dies off camera in the epilogue).

For the multiplayer, I tried it but personally I just didn't really like it. It just felt too wooden and the best parts of the single player game have to be mostly eliminated to play against/with others. Other people might find a lot of hours of fun here, but for me I played it for a night and was done with it.

So overall, I enjoyed the game but by the end I was just left disappointed by what it offered. This isn't a bad game, but I don't think I would readily highly recommend it to anyone.

Edit: I increased my rating to 4 stars because I did enjoy the game, and I haven't liked some of the other games I've played lately.","Lots of Fun, but the Action Becomes Tired by the End",1339027200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It was well worth the wait. The game is premiering on all three major game systems at once, and although each version is essentially the same, each game has one distinct quality: They feature different lead characters. For the Playstation, it's Heihachi. For the Gamecube, it's Link. For the XBox, it's Spawn. They're joined by many of the classic characters from the original game, plus some great new ones. The biggest question, however, is this: What prevents this from just being another run-of-the-mill fighting game, another Kakuto Chojin or another Mortal Kombat clone? One needn't worry.
Although similar in style to other combat games, this one rises above them with extraordinary gameplay, first-rate graphics (esp. on the Cube and XBox) and surprisingly easy controls and fighting techniques. The attacks are pretty straightforward: kick, horizontal weapon, and vertical weapon. But there are some good combination moves available, as well. Like all other combat games, this requires button/control combinations and some well-timed maneuvering. Unfortunately, the XBox's Controller S is not well-suited for these moves; the buttons aren't aligned very well for some of the trickier attacks. (My thumbs still ache from playing Kakuto Chojin on the Controller S; of the 3 systems, only the PS2's basic controller was the most user-friendly. A possible solution: Try the Mad Catz MicroCon controller for the XBox). However, the XBox has other advantages that may offset the sometimes difficult controller. The XBox's excellent graphics engine (by far the best of the three systems) make this game a sumptuous visual treat; the player is surrounded by beautifully detailed scenery and environments. Gameplay on the XBox--thanks to its superior hardware--is smooth and load times are not a problem. There's really just one problem with the game: no story, plot or goals. Basically, you just fight. If you don't mind a straightforward fighting game, then this is your cup of tea. Truthfully, it's not that much different from the first version. But if it ain't broke...

LOVE:
- Perfect size! Fits the adult hand exactly right.

- Comfortable! Has a smooth matte finish that is a treat to touch

- User friendly! Excellent scroller, back/forward buttons on the side and adjustable CPI (how fast your curser moves).

- Lightshow! The lighting effects are even better in person than they are pictured on the listing. The colors change consistently and the spider web design makes it look like something right out of the future. All your friends will be insanely jealous, guaranteed.

COULD USE IMPROVEMENT:
- Lightshow doesn't turn off - although I LOVE the light effects, my computer is in my bedroom and when the lights go out the mouse literally lights up the entire room. Unfortunately there's no way to turn off the lights without unplugging the mouse.

- Startup lag - I don't know why this happens, but when you 'wake' your computer from sleep it takes a few seconds for the mouse to startup. This is weird to me, because if you move the mouse it will wake up the computer, but once it's awake the mouse has to like turn itself off and back on again to register. It takes all of like 4 seconds, but still kinda annoying.

OVERALL: As a total geek for anything that lights up, I'm an instant fan of this mouse. There are a few improvements that could be made for future generations, but even still I'm very impressed. I was expecting the quality of the mouse to suffer to make room for the light effects, but actually this is a REALLY high quality mouse that just so happens to also have psychedelic lights within.

Be aware that if you're new to roleplaying (as I was)and EQ then the learning curve to understand and get started on EQ will be quite large.
A quick list of Pros and Cons:
Pros
EQ is HUGE. There are dozens of ""zones"" to play in and getting to zones is relatively easy, depending on your class and knowledge of zone connections.
The time commitment required is huge, so if you're looking for a game that won't be over quickly, that's EQ. Think of playing your character as a very long-term hobby. Unfortunately for some, it seems to be much more than that.
There are thousands of interesting items to buy, sell, collect, use, and combine. How items (weapons, armor, and otherwise) are used can be very confusing but there is an abundance of free info on the net. Understand this is intended to be a game of discovery, so many quests, items, and rules were meant to be discovered, not given to you.
The number of monsters to kill is enormous and the graphics for most is very pleasing and the animation and sound very entertaining.
There are literally hundreds (if not thousands) of players on at a time, which means (ideally) there's always someone to group with.
You can join groups of players in guilds, which can help you in countless ways. You can also easily quit a guild if it's not to your liking (as I've done on several occasions)
Cons
The biggest negatives of the game don't involve the game itself so much as the people you encounter. Although I've come across many friendly and helpful people, there are also many negative, bossy, and downright rude people in the game. Too many people take the game way too seriously and don't realize they're just data on a server in an office. As a newbie, you may run into a lot of condescending people who somehow think their level in the game makes them worthy of mocking others. Again, they're just data on a server.
The ""quests"" are not very interesting and mainly involve alot of running around and collecting items to get a reward item.
The overall story of EQ is rather obscured by the overall kill-to-level push of the game.
If you don't make an effort to immerse yourself in the game's world, the game is basically just a kill-to-level game. The developers have mastered the psychological aspect to push people to want to level (by provide surnames at certain levels and new spells every 5 levels or so, for example) so everyone will know just how ""powerful"" your character is. All the presentation aside, the entire simplified goal of the game is getting to the next level, thus making your character more powerful so you can go to a higher level zone.
The startup time for a newbie is painfully slow. Getting your first character enough EQ money (platinum) to properly equip the character can take weeks or months, which can easily kill the fun in the game.
Unfortunately, I've found the social aspect of the game more of a con than pro. Perhaps it's the type of people who play, perhaps it's because there are many younger (12-16 year olds) playing, but I find that soloing was much more fun simply because I didn't have to deal with real-life bad attitudes when all I wanted to do was immerse myself in a fantasy world for a few hours a day.",If you have the time and can deal with other players...,1067126400,39,,

4.0,True,"01 19, 2015",A1NRCHRSDXYFW5,B00IZXXF92,Luis M. Fuentes,"This review is for the BlackWidow Tournament Edition Stealth Keyboard.

This keyboard is great. I love that the USB cable is detachable similar to the keyboards seen in the hobby circles (Ducky, Vortex, etc.). The included USB cable is braided, as small as this addition seems, it makes a big difference in the long term reliability of the cable.

The surface of the keyboard is a smooth matte finish. It has a nice heft towards the top due to the wedge shape which makes it feel sturdy. It also comes with a velvet carrying bag, making lugging this thing around hassle free if you are on the go.

Since this is a tenkeyless keyboard (as in to say it does not have a numberpad) it has a smaller footprint. Great for those with small desks and again, those on the go.

Let's talk switches. Razer has two types of switches: Razer greens and Razer oranges. If you are familiar with hobby mechanical keyboard then you have heard of Cherry MX, which is probably the leader in mechanical switches. The Razer greens are an equivalent to the Cherry MX blues. This keys have an audible ""click"" when typing. They are also the units you are likely to find in stores. However, this Stealth edition has Razer Oranges, which are more like the Cherry MX browns. They have a ""tactile"" feeling but remain quiet.

With that said, we should really discuss what I mean by ""quiet"". If you are expecting this to make zero noise, you need to reassess your exceptions. In effect, if the Razer Greens make a ""click"" sound, the Razer Oranges make a ""clack"" sound. But even though it makes a sound, it is still quieter than the greens or MX cherry blues. The oranges take the edge off the sound and removes the piercing ""click"", which can be distracting to those around you, people on vent, or in live-streams (unless you have some noise canceling going on in your mic). So again, it's a less obtrusive sound.

Now for the quality of the keys/switches;I prefer the Razer greens and Razer oranges over the MX Cherry equivalents. I prefer the action and ""tightness"" of the switch over those of the Cherries. I should be fair in saying that the switches will ""break"" in eventually during use, since this is a new keyboard, but this is true for any mechanical keyboard. The changes over time are not major, but I am hoping it retains the characteristics I enjoy of each keystroke over time.

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the keys are not backlit. This would be the perfect,  tenkeyless keyboard, if only the thing was backlit.

Razer, if you are listening, I would gladly pay $20 more for a Pro edition of this thing, that has the back lighting. Hell, make a Chroma version and charge $40 more.

If you do not mind the keys not being back-lit and are in the market for a tenkeyless keyboard, I would highly recommend this bad boy. But me personally?

This keyboard only made me want more. I ended up ordering the BlackWidow ultimate stealth because I really prefer to have something with back-lighting. And even though I order the tournament edition because I wanted to save on desk space, I didn't realize how much I would miss the number pad (I do 10 key typing quite often throughout the week).

What will happen to my Tournament Edition Stealth? I will be taking it with me to the office and using it at work. It will be a treat to use while typing up emails or sneaking in a CS:GO game during downtime ;)",Could have been 5 stars with a small addition.,1421625600,4,,

4.0,False,"10 16, 2008",A278KWZ6FSE0S7,B000VJRU44,Annie,"Wii Fit is a fun activity for the Wii. I specify ""activity"" because it's not really much of a game. It's enjoyable, there are challenges, and occasionally you will rack up some points, but it's not really a game. It's marketed as a game that happens to be exercise, but in reality it's just exercise that feels like a game. The difference is important because if you decide to create a Wii Fit regimen in the hopes that you can play an hour of games a day and exercise at the same time, you'll probably be disappointed. If you hate exercising already, the Wii Fit won't make it enjoyable, it will make it bearable.

The reason Wii Fit makes exercising bearable is because it sets small goals (you might exercise for an hour a day, but it's broken up into a series of three or five minute segments), it gives you rewards (in the form of unlocking new activities or other game features), and it's even fun sometimes (particularly the balance games portion). Essentially, it takes your mind off of the fact that you're sweating and possibly miserable.

In short, I love Wii Fit. I like the ability to tailor a workout to your strengths (or, conversely, work on your weaknesses) by being able to mix up a variety of activities from yoga, strength training, and aerobics. Despite my love of it, however, it has a one major flaw: it is extremely judgmental for being a friendly-looking video game. If I wanted someone to make me feel bad about myself, I could call my mother up, thanks.

First of all, it relies heavily on BMI, which is not an accurate standard. It's a good starting point for judging health, but it is by no means comprehensive. People with high muscle mass (myself included) can seem overweight. Also, BMI is a horrible indicator for children, who tend to plump out before a growth spurt or become slightly underweight immediately after one.

Secondly, this game will judge every ounce you gain. It doesn't give a crap if you're putting on muscle mass, are wearing a heavy sweatshirt, have indigestion, or just ate. Normal bodies will fluctuate in weight -- up to one or two percent -- for almost no reason at all. This is normal. Wii Fit, however, will ask you WHY you gained that quarter of a pound and ask you to choose from a list of reasons. Even if you non-committally answer with, ""I don't know."" The game will tell you to watch what you eat. If you dare to answer ""Indigestion"" twice in a row, it says something along the lines of ""Indigestion AGAIN, eh?"" And then implies that you're probably fibbing. All of the game's ribbing is relatively good natured, but the fact remains that any weight gain is looked down on. Conversely, even though it shames you for gaining half a pound, it doesn't congratulate you for losing half a pound. So until you reach a pre-set goal, you usually hear mostly chiding comments.

Being shamed by a video game isn't really one of my life's concerns, however, so I don't let that deter me from enjoying Wii Fit. However, if you are sensitive about your weight and/or are recovering from an eating disorder, it might be best to skip this one. Otherwise, have fun with it and don't take the talking balance board personally.",Oodles Of Fun With One Caveat,1224115200,10,,

As other reviewers have said, ""Suikoden is back.""  Suikoden 3 was the ""black sheep"" of the family, doing different things that made some players love it, others hate it.  Suikoden 5 harkens directly back to old Suikoden 2.  But...is that still a good thing?

***THE GOOD***

STORY - The story is incredible.  For once, FOR ONCE, the world does not evolve around a anonymous spiky-haired hero.  Matter of fact, in the first 6-10 hours of the game, barely anyone cares about you, period.  You're the male son of a matriarchal country, and everyone is more concerned with your little sister than you.  This is a VERY REFRESHING change of pace, and makes the whole game world feel 100x more ""real.""  A plot twist occurs after 6-10 hours of playtime, which was visible from the start of the game...but it was still surprisingly emotional, nonetheless.  After that, the world slowly does begin to revolve around you, but at least they do it in a semi-believable way.  And the other twists in this awesome story are ones you will NOT see coming.  The characters are all extremely well-developed.  There are a few cookie-cutter anime archetypes, but overall, the characters are believable...or at least likeable.

GRAPHICS - Although it doesn't support progressive scan like Suikoden 4, the graphics here are very solid.  Beautiful environments, great character models...very pretty overall.

***THE BAD***

GAMEPLAY - There are 6-character parties this time around, with the option to carry around about 4 other characters to switch with whenever you wish, even during battles.  I say ""about"" 4 other characters because I don't know for sure.  I never used it.  I barely used anything during battles besides the ""Auto"" button.  If you put ANY time AT ALL into trying to improve your characters (equipping good armor, runes, upgrading weapons, etc.), then you'll blow past most every enemy in the game.  Even BOSS enemies may go down in one round.  You can make your characters go into a specific ""Formation"", which you find in chests around the world (?) - these Formations each have special attributes, such as giving all party members +10 Attack, etc.

The battle system is also very zoomed out, so you'll just have to trust that those monster designs look cool and interesting.  You won't be able to see them much.  You can use Co-op skills, where a pair of characters in your party join up to unleash the hurt on the enemies.  There's also the Formation skill, which is a special skill involving all members of your party, which is specific to which Formation you have equipped at the time.  These special skills look absolutely ridiculous when they're carried out, with no effort whatsoever put into creating the animation, and, well, THOUGHT that would make them fun to execute.

CUTSCENES - Once in a while there's a ""special"" movie that involves voices and zoomed-in camera angles, but the huge majority of cutscenes in the game take place with a birds' eye-view.  So you're mostly staring at the pretty anime pictures and reading the (well-written) dialogue.  But for some reason, the game designers still have those little dots that are the characters bow, or wave, or do some other blurry action.  This means that you'll read something short, like ""All right,"" in the dialog box...but the 'continue' prompt won't pop up for 10-15 seconds because one of those blurry characters is doing a slow bow or whatever.  This is frustrating.

***OVERALL***

It's just painful to see games with this level of dated tactics still being released.  You walk through a prison.  All the NPC prisoners look the same, except...oh, there's a guy wearing a red COSTUME sitting back there!  I guess he's a Plot Character!  Also, want to bring a party of women to sneak into a male-only guard encampment?  Go ahead and do it!  The game doesn't know who's in your party.  The only people who even appear in the cutscenes are the ones that the game is forcing you to have.  So you walk into a town with 6 people in your group, but as far as the story and movies go, there's only 2 there.  This completely, utterly destroys any sense of immersion you may have had.  We shouldn't see stuff like that in this day and age.

So, overall - while the plot is excellent, the gameplay keeps this from being a true classic.  It's not very fun to run around an ugly world map, sitting through loading screens to extremely easy battles...and keep at it for 50+ hours.  It's not very fun, but it is bareable - and there are aspects that will interest you, whether it's getting new Formations, Runes, or upgrading weapons.  Along with the excellent story, this game is a solid 4 out of 5 stars in my book.",A classic RPG...and a classic example of why RPGs need to evolve,1153353600,4,,

1. When defending, all you can really do is run alongside the ball handler and try to pressure him off of the ball. That's it. Timing a tackle can also work, but if you miss, you're in odd-man situation and the AI does a fairly good job at working a shot.
2. Trying to execute a 'trick' move is very hard to do, must be anticipated well in advance, and even then, there is little success. Even in extreme situations (i.e. C Ronaldo vs. any Derby County defender - get the point).

Also, the AI seems very proficient at corner kicks - much more proficient then you will find you will be able to be. But enough criticism. The game is fun, has very little framerate issues (you'll see a slight hesitation rarely), has great stadiums & kits and plays well online. This is a big step for this franchise and sets the stage for a (potentially) very strong, PES-challenging game platform. In fact, FIFA '08 is strong enough to make those of us fluent in the PES/Winning Eleven series to start nit-picking that game (mainly, the lack of licensing and amount of editing needed to be done to present the teams & kits properly). What's important at the end of the day, however, is the play on the pitch, and FIFA has made big strides. It's not quite as smooth and responsive as PES, but the gap is narrowing and ""Seabass"" (the producer of PES 2008) should be on DEFCOM alert 4.

4.0,False,"01 13, 2015",A221XX7B6B8EYY,B00KAED6RU,Nicht Viel,"I was not a huge fan of far cry 3. I felt like the characters were vapid and uninteresting. The scripted ""helpless"" scenarios (where they knock you out and take everything away) really peeved me. The button mashing scripted events were painfully jarring and annoying. The bad guys were two dimensional and stupid enough that it actually made your white bread no experience beach trash protagonist more credible. I played the game through once. I had no investment in the characters and hated the good and bad guys equally for their lack of character or believability. I was so emotionally removed from the ending decision that I honestly can't remember which way I went.

Far Cry 4 is a huge step up from this experience. While the gameplay is very similar to 3, the characters are a huge improvement. In addition to a somewhat believable if fantastic protagonist, the main evil of this story is witty, charming, and in general vastly entertaining. I found myself actually laughing at some of his sarcastic radio diatribes about suits (meat pockets) or lancing boils (employ a professional). Troy Baker (his voice actor) very much puts me in mind of Ben Kingsly (so much so that I had to look it up). This is due in part to his excellent voice acting and on the occasions that you see him the animation of his character. In general, the realism of your adventure is awe inspiring at times.

The weapons are very similar to the previous games. You will see a few new smaller weapons and the addition of signatures (unmodifiable but powerful versions of your existing weapons) but everything else is what you'd expect. This isn't a bad thing as the mix from farcry 2 and 3 was pretty well done. I was glad to see the M79 grenade launcher carried over as a sidearm. There is nothing as enjoyable as gliding over an enemy stronghold in a buzzer lobbing grenade after grenade to a satisfying THONK. The enemy AI is pretty good. They will generally react properly to you whether you are stealthy or blasting away full volume. I loved the fortresses (bring lots of grenade launcher ammo and a swear jar) and the vehicles (buzzer definitely a favorite). There are a lot of nice touches with the inventory system that most people will not notice. For instance, I am impressed that the developers would go to the lengths of making sure that the quick sale option also removes crafting items (furs) from your inventory that you will not need to make future items. In other words, if none of the crafting items you need to create in the future (even ones that haven't been unlocked yet) need a certain fur, the quick sale will remove it from your inventory. This is brilliant since it means that you will never have to hold onto a bunch of useless items in case the next level of crafting a holster/bag might require them.

There are a few negative notes though they do not stop me from enjoying the game. The skirmish karma event is pretty silly. Pretty much until you approach directly you will see 3 red guys and 3 blue guys blasting away at each other at point blank with no one taking any damage. Another thing that annoyed the crap out of me was that every time you secure a stronghold, deliver a shipment, or dare to blink your eyes your knucklehead allies with fire their automatic rifles into the air indefinitely. It's super annoying and distracting when there is something else nearby you need to take care of. And eagles. Every time I turned around an eagle was swooping down on humans as if they could possible kill or consume them.

I have to put these issues separate since they're carry overs from farcry 3. Wearing body armor does not make you invincible or even resistant to .50 caliber rounds. You can shoot one of the ""heavies"" three to four times in the torso with a heavy sniper rifle (on normal!) only to watch them shake it off and keep coming. This is a round that can penetrate a 500 pound cast iron engine block. Your impromptu duct tape jungle armor is not going to make a round the width of my thumb bounce off. Even the fact that you can empty an entire clip of full length rifle ammo (not shortened AK ammo, but full size 7.62x54 or .30 caliber equivalent) into them with no effect is ridiculous. No body armor is that effective against high powered rifle ammo. The number of times I've seen these smug SOBs shrug off ridiculous damage is maddening. I also strongly dislike jumping puzzles. The bell towers are a carryover from farcry 3's radio towers and I was not a fan of them. It just seemed like the same jumping puzzle over and over to increasing levels of annoyance.

I am loving this game very much. I am about 50% of the way through and have really liked what I've seen so far. As critical as I am of 3, I feel like UBI Soft has gotten their collective stuff together and made a memorable and enjoyable experience. Aside from a few annoyances this is one of the best games I've played in last couple years. And while the graphics and gameplay are a large part of that, it's nice to see some better characters and writing.

EDIT: I've finished the game on the first play through now. I have a few more thoughts about the game in general as a result.

Positives: I was very happy to see even more weapons added to the available list as I completed the second half of the game. Many of them (particularly the ""buzz-saw"") were enormously fun and satisfying to use. I played through the fashion show quests to get my ammo/grenade/loot/etc. capacity upgraded and they tended to be a lot of fun.

Negatives: I started to realize that after the Shangri-la missions that the game was dumping most of my ammo inventory. In other words, when I came back from them I had to spend a ridiculous amount of money reloading my ammo. At this point in the game I had completed most or all of the fashion show side quests so I could carry quite a bit. I know achievements are silly, but I noticed that completing a lot of things (mostly finishing all of a type of side quest) did not provide any sort of achievement. The Shangri-la missions aren't too bad until you get to the boss. I felt like the fight was a bit cheap though after reading up I managed to complete it the third time (standard difficulty).

Replayability: I definitely see myself going back to play through this at least once more to try a different path. I didn't feel like my choices in 3 made much of a difference but 4 gives you enough times to make decisions that I feel it could significantly alter the experience.",Not a huge fan of 3 and this is a large improvement.,1421107200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

It might have been used to counter inadequacies in the last game.  But its not even close to making it better this time around.  You should just be able to save at random.  Otherwise you have to wait until you get to that certain save point and then stop where your at.  Instead of being able to just stop at anytime.

I do like finally being able to play as Marth in a Fire Emblem game.  It kind of sucks though that your not able to get him to another class.  He does get one of the better weapons in the game later on.  But it would have been nice to have that option and aside from the occasional hiccup.  I found myself enjoying the game being a big FE fan that doesn't hurt.

However i would've liked to have a more personal connection to the players in the game.  I didn't get that bent out of shape or flustered when one of the died. I'm sure that there's a purpose behind this maybe an extra chapter or storyline perhaps.

For people that are new to the series its a solid entry into the Fire Emblem world and worthy of a purchase.  The gameplay itself isn't that difficult/cumbersome and most should be able to pick it up and go with it no problem.

Aloy controls and handles really well, boasting strong animations and tight handles. Combat is very satisfying and robust. You have many different ways to take down foes, and them you. Each time you encounter a new beast you do have to analyze it's strengths and weaknesses, else you'll most likely lose (or retreat). Once you learn how to defeat an enemy, and once you get better equipment, the fights become a bit more routine ... but they are still fun, and still dangerous.

While the strength of the game is its gameplay, its weakness is the questing, characters, and story. While the story is entertaining from the stand point of being unique, it isn't told in a really grand or interesting way. The characters themselves (Aloy included) are very cliche (tribal dolts) and uninspired. Nothing truly stands out, and you often go to yourself, ""Who is this? Why do I care? Didn't I just see the same NPC elsewhere? What's his/her name? Does it matter?"" The questing is generic---nothing we haven't seen 100x over in other RPGs, MMORPGs, and quest-centric games before.

Yes, I know you may look at the reviews of the game here and think that something might be wrong with the game, or that it might be defective. It is not. In fact it was well reviewed. If you look at Metacritic website it has average score of 85% out of 100%, which is relatively very high grade for any game. That is based on 31 professional review websites. Then you come here and see all the negative comments how ""gems are useless"" or ""we cannot have local coop against online!"" or ""There is DLC on the disk, so it should be free!"" About Local Coop, perhaps it sucks, but it does not make any game unfair, since the opponent plays by the same rules. Regarding content on disk, neither in practical terms or legal terms any locked content on the disk should be free. It is like saying the game is on the disk, so I should see all the open source code for it. Also keep in mind. ONLY 3 revies have a mark on their review as ""verified Amazon purchase"" and those three people gave the game decent and constructive criticism. Why would others come a website from which they did not buy the game and review the game, not even mentioning they're reviewing special edition. Only answer is there are some forums online where gamers read about games, game complaints, and someone suggested they go to all the sites and write negative reviews about the game.

Now to get to my review of Street Fighter VS. Tekken. It is by far not a bad game. The graphics are very fast 60 frames per second. If you care about the visuals then you can't be disappointed with this. Everything is shinier, more lifelike, and you see textures you have not seen before in fighting game. I think rendering of skin textures has gotten much better than previous Capcom fighters. Sometimes you'll see when characters start sweating, and some players will enjoy seeing that, if they play certain characters. You get many characters to choose from at the start. As you play though the campaign with two characters you choose, you can follow somewhat of a story. Nothing special about this plot. Just good characters fighting evil ones. But what you do get to see is very interesting cutscenes explaining why each character paired up with another and it creates a coherent continuity. The stages and the environment are also rather diverse and creative as you are not limited to one stage, but can perform special moves that will throw the characters either into another battlefield, or below a collapsed building, all accompanied by cool cut scenes. Audio and music are ok, by default the characters have Japanese voice overs, but you are able to switch them to English and back selectively, for specific characters.

I've played video and computer games, including fighting games, over fifteen years, and I think gameplay here mostly resembles Marvel vs Capcom in high speed of the fights, and the moves correspond to respective games, whether Street Fighter or Tekken. However, some might find problems here as some super moves have been slightly modified and you might not get the same move unless you check the moves list.
A lot of people complain about the idea of gems. That they will create unbalanced gameplay, or that they are useless. I think whether you like the gem system will depend on the skill of the player. For example I want my characters to move faster so I will try to use speed up Gem whenever possible. Of course this needs a lot of practice to figure out which ones you might need since big and slow characters such as  Hugo or Zangief will need a gem that might help you if you think they are too slow, or gems that increase damage points may help weaker, smaller characters. I personally like the gem system because when I modify any given character with a few gems it feels like an entirely different character. You have to perform a certain action to activate some of the activated gems, while others are passive, ones with weaker effects have easier activation, and vice versa

[ABOUT 'SPECIAL EDITION']
Ok, like others said, the special edition is ironically nothing special at all. It is $10 more than the standard edition but it gives  you access to all the gems present in the game from the start. The ""present"" you get is a plastic DIY toy coin bank that looks like a arcade cabinet. I didn't open it, but from what it looks like, honestly it is like a happy meal toy. Then again, this is not a ""Collector's Edition"" of any sort, its just ""Special Edition""
It was advertised that the buyer will get a special, unique, exclusive Comic Book. This was definitely a rip off. The ""Comic Book"" is just a part of the extra thick manual that is inside the case. You know how you get really fat manuals for fighting games? This is just that but with ""comic pages"" printed on back.
So for $10 extra, the ""special edition"" gets 2 or 3 out of 5, depending how much you value the things I described and gems.",Excellent Game Lots of Fun Characters And Great Customization,1332028800,8,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

The interface is definitely improved and the game does not have as many visual flaws in it that the 10th edition had. I like how the new sets are structured. Also it is cool how you have to play a certain number of games to ""unlock certain sets."" That is kind of a reward/motivator to play more games.

4.0,False,"03 31, 2016",A2K7OP4VPIHQU9,B0166QDJDQ,Chalgyr&#039;s Game Room,"Far Cry is a series well-known for its violence, but also for its heavy use of firearms. This makes the newest offering in the series, Far Cry Primal, something of an unusual entry into the series as there is not a gun in sight. That being said, a lot of the things the series is known for - both for better and for worse - are on full display here. At the end of the day however, I found myself enjoying the title a great deal, despite some issues here and there.

First and foremost, I am going to address my biggest gripe about the game - but the story is just paper thin. I loved the effort that went into trying to create an authentic sounding language for the tribesman to speak in, it just winds up falling flat because they very seldom have anything to say. There are two reasons for this. The first is the relatively flat, open world nature that Far Cry is so well known for. This means you can tackle story quests in a relatively loose order of your choosing, but the end result is that these events just feel tacked on and not really structurally important to the narrative.

Perhaps of even greater concern is the lack of an interesting villain. The opposing tribesmen that you are dealing with lack the sort of leader or foil that Pagan Min so brilliantly provided for us in Far Cry 4. While I would not go so far as to say the story in Far Cry 4 was anything special in and of itself, it did provide one of the more memorable antagonists in video game history, but we lack even that to help anchor the storytelling in Primal.

If you enjoy open world games and everything that entails (lots of seemingly random quests of scant actual importance, areas to explore, resource gathering, etc) - then there is a great deal to like here. Between the prior Far Cry, Assassin's Creed games and even Watchdogs, it is safe to say that Ubisoft has found their comfortable niche that they do really well - like Square Enix and RPGs or Arc System Works with 2D fighting games. It is simply what they are known for, and by and large Ubisoft has their formula down pat, even if they are not regularly taking risks with it.

Combat plays out a few different ways, with ranged attacks, melee and the option for limited stealth. Human enemies try to overwhelm you with numbers, while the creatures you encounter in the wild sometimes pose hulking threats in and of themselves. While a deer or monkey may try to run away, a cave lion or brown bear is libel to turn you into its next meal. However, as frightening as these beasts may be, the also open up the window to perhaps the most entertaining new aspect of the game - beast taming.

Fairly early in the story structure, your character winds up experiencing a vision that gives him control over an owl that you can see through the eyes of, and later in the game even use as an offensive weapon (think dropping poison or bees nests on enemies). Awesome for trying to take over more difficult enemy encampments. However, you can tame some of the more dangerous predators in the wild as well, and even ride them if your mastery skills get high enough. I cannot count the number of times I ran back into a difficult fight, just to restore my sabertooth  tiger. I fed it almost any time it was wounded, and used the pet option on it far more than I should probably admit. I got attached to him over most of the creatures, all of which have slightly different skills and abilities ranging from sheer strength and swiftness to special abilities that might help recover resources or see more of the minimap. This was without a doubt my favorite innovation for the game, despite the fact that really, these are pretty standard fare AI companions.

There are plenty of solid progression hooks that kept me playing above and beyond my irrational affection for my big kitty cat. The leveling system provides lots of different abilities that can be unlocked. Finding new tribesman gives you new skills that can be unlocked as well. The tribe you build up, complete with population increases, automated resource gathering and the option to build up and improve the huts of the aforementioned key tribesman was actually pretty addicting as well.

Far Cry Primal takes a familiar formula, and while it falls somewhat flat from a narrative standpoint, the setting is actually a surprisingly good fit. The brutal world comes to life with excellent visuals and a steady framerate that is complimented by a new language and appropriate music. The beast mastery was a great twist on what Far Cry usually presents, but it also left me wishing for just a few more chances being taken with the gameplay. Exploration is a lot of fun and I enjoyed finding new areas and unlocking new perks in my village. I do however wish that the main story itself and the antagonists were more interesting, as the game itself is solid fun but also somewhat forgettable when everything is said and done.",A great twist on a well-known formula,1459382400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,True,"01 13, 2017",A2PUJFSRDW8N1M,B001CXYMFS,Nazosan,"This is a great entry-level HOTUS style joystick.  I'm also using it for Elite Dangerous and it works great.  There are only four things I really don't like about it, one of which most people may not experience.
1.  It's all plastic.  A simple, very thin and cheap rubber on the joystick where you grip it and on the throttle as well would be great.  (And I think on the POV hat it would be good too.)  Also, just a hint on the buttons even perhaps (particularly the trigger, which hurts a little if you hit it wrong -- wel, maybe some sort of softer plastic or something would do for the buttons.)  I've used Sugru to effectively do this myself, but Sugru starts to come loose after a while if it's a thin enough layer to be effective.  This wouldn't have to add to the real cost of the product since no real research or seriously high quality materials are needed for this, so as far as I can tell it's simply an oversight.  The rubber isn't just necessary for a better and more comfortable grip, but if your hand sweats at all it starts to slip on the plastic.  (And, unfortunately, as efficient as my computer is -- and it's much more efficient than your average gaming system -- my room still gets notably warmer when I play this game for a long time.)
2.  The tightness level on the absolute maximum is insufficient to my tastes at least.  I like the balance of precision I can get if it is really tight with still being able to move the ship quickly as needed.  I actually modified mine for a higher level of tightness.
3.  It creaks.  Now, I think this is really just something where I simply need to break it in over time, but I guess it will take a very long time if this is so because I'm using it quite a lot right now and the creaking shows absolutely no signs of decreasing whatsoever.  My old non-HOTUS Thrustmaster T-Flightstick X had the exact same internal design for the joystick itself and it does not creak now.  However, I have no memory if it did back when I got it so very many years ago now.  I think I would remember, but it has been a very very long time.
4.  The button to the right side on the joystick near the trigger (number 3) is ridiculously easy to bump.  It's not quite as soft of a touch as the old T-Flightstick X one was, but it's very very close.  On the old one I actually modified it, removing the large button and rigging up something very tiny that was much harder to bump and I may have to do that for this one too.

Now, those things aside, this is a great way to get started and after modifications I do really like it.  Obviously a more expensive model can be a lot nicer, but this is a really good way to get started without breaking the bank.  Especially if you only want it for one or two games.  You have enough buttons to map to practically any major function and, unlike the lesser models, the buttons are laid out in a very easy to operate manner.  I do find the huge analog ""button"" on the throttle to be a bit useless for most tasks, but it has its minor uses I guess.  It's very stiff and goes back to center a little too fast, so I just can't use it for much (though it might be good for something that needs fine precision.  Perhaps lateral thrusters where left and right are all that matter -- or up and down if you don't mind it being less intuitive.)  Unfortunately, in PC mode if you bump the ""home"" button, rather than it acting as another button, it switches to PS3 mode.  In PS3 mode you lose one throttle control (that large analog is the same as the twist if I remember right) and it seems to be a bit less accurate and smooth moving.  But all you have to do is press it again to switch back (and the light indicates which mode it's in as well.  Green for PC mode, red for PS3 mode.)  I don't bump it much, but this is something to bear in mind I suppose.

Now, on the plusses.
1.  Lots of buttons and a hat switch.  (Ok, just one hat switch, but those with two or more seem more inconvenient than not to me.)
2.  The buttons are all (except the last two) arranged where you can press any of them without moving your hands around.
3.  Overall a pretty sturdy design.  While I haven't had this one long, I've had its baby brother without the separate throttle section and that thing has taken punishment and lasted a very very long time.  I've taken both apart and materials and build design are virtually identical, so I fully expect this one to hold up just as well.
4.  The throttle has a good catch in the middle that is easy enough to get out of but you don't slip right past.  Especially handy in Elite if you map to the full throttle as the middle is usually right in the sweet spot for maximum maneuverability (except in supercruise where it's just above it and easy to find by feel.)  For forward + reverse mapping it's easy to get it to zero and bump it up slightly as needed, though of course you lose some of the control from a full mapping.
5.  Both have a very comfortable rest.  The joystick supports the bottom of your hand well and the throttle is easy to hold without effort.  In long trips I can just rest my arm on the throttle even.  (Hey, it works.)
6.  This thing is not tiring to use at all and I can go more hours than I rightly should in Elite Dangerous with this thing even when I should have gone to sleep hours ago.  That's even with the extra tension I've added to the spring.  The movement is good overall other than the creaking I mentioned when I make smaller movements.

I would definitely recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to plunk down a lot of money for a high end HOTUS style joystick.  And I definitely recommend it far more than the joysticks without the separate throttle even in higher price ranges.  (As I said, I've used the little brother without a proper throttle and you just completely lose the level of precision and responsiveness that you really do need without a proper full throttle as this provides.)  Not just for dogfights, but normal usage even.  Given how much more you have to spend to get something that's truly nicer with the same features, this is probably the absolute best you can get for its price range by far.  (Excluding buying used perhaps.)

PS.  It should go without saying, but the parts are shaped for a right handed person.  Left handed people look elsewhere.  It will not adapt to left handed use at all.","Great entry-level HOTUS.

Ninjatown is a tower defense strategy game based on Shawnimals plush toys (if you don't know what they are, don't worry I didn't either before the game).  Essentially the game involves you trying to defend Ninjatown from the invading Mr. Demon and his forces.  You are asked to put up houses where various types of ninjas live each with their own unique abilities.  In addition you can build huts that improve your ninjas' attributes (and sometimes other advantages).

The game is fun and addicting.  The levels do get increasingly difficult and there are always new huts, ninjas, or enemies being introduced.  Plus some of the cut scenes are truly funny.  However, there are some minor drawbacks to the game.  First, the game doesn't really ""evolve"" at all.  You are essentially doing the same thing in stage 1 as you are in the last.  Now don't get me wrong, what you are doing is fun (if you like tower defense types of games), but that's ALL there is here - no character development, no carryover weapons to the next level, no side quests or mini-games.

4.0,True,"08 19, 2012",AU70G084OYMMM,B0028IBTLG,A.J.,"I played fallout 3 back when I had an xbox 360 and gave up on it in about 2 hours. That was my attention span at the time. I bought a ps3 like 18 months ago(my fav console now) and really started to experiment with all kinds of game genres. I play all sorts of games but wanted to experience an rpg that would engage me into the game. I knew that I needed an rpg that at least had guns to keep my interest. I picked up new vegas in hope that I would like the fallout series this time around.

First off, it might be hard to get into this game, it was for me. I was again about to give up on the game since I usually enjoy games like gta, saints row, rage, metal gear solid etc. basically games that you get into the action quickly without much BS. Fallout requires some patience, choosing your skills/perks wisely, leveling up well, finding what combat style suits you best, using drugs to increase AP in VATS, selling/buying things, and the list goes on. Fallout requires thought and the player must plan out how he/she will approach the various objectives/situations. I was going to give up on the game because you have to walk to all locations to discover them, and trust me there is a lot of walking. For some reason just as I was about to quit on fallout, it kinda grew on me. I started to understand it all of a sudden and then started to enjoy it as well.

After putting in about 60 hours into the game and beating it, I must say it was a great adventure. All the characters I met, all the choices I made(good and bad), the VATS system, finding all those locations, helping or backstabbing certain factions/people, and doing the various side missions was a blast. I can still go back and play the game siding with the other factions to get those missions, so this game also has replay value.

Now for the cons and problems, thankfully I didn't experience many but the game does freeze up on you forcing you to restart your ps3 and losing any progress if you had not saved. I experienced about 6-7 freezes which isn't that bad but it was annoying to restart your system so do save often. Another thing was with sound, some times the sound would become static-y for no reason for like 10-15 minutes. This happened to me about twice.
The game could have better graphics I mean it came out in 2010, I have games from 2008 with superior graphics, I know its a big game but still. The game can get boring at times, it will tell you to travel a long distance to talk to some scouts and then go back and talk to the main guy which will take like an hour with no action just travelling and talking. The side missions could have been better. There where at least 5 side missions which had you find evidence against someone and then talk to them or kill them. Environments could be more diverse, most buildings and locations were very similar.

Overall this was a great game even with its flaws it had moments where it shined and was a blast to play. For the current price its going for I would say that everyone add this game to their collection.

It's the only video game I have ever received for Christmas so it was quite an appreciated gift! Nevertheless hard times caused me to part with the DC original for some quick cash. I was relieved when they announced the title for the GameCube, with some additional material.

 While there are a few new elements added to the saga I must confess that by and large the game is largely true to the original, which can be both good and bad. In the ways its good is that the story remains largely unchanged, and what has changed helps to advance the story. However the game's graphics have not been enhanced much at all, and on my TV (Wide screen, HD, and 53"") the graphical flaws can really stand out. While the colors seem more vibrant, but there is visible rendering quite close to the main character as he navigates the game. The scenery looks muddy, but smoothes out gradually as Vyse approaches, and you can actually see the lines render the graphics. This was an eye sore in the original, and I had hoped Sega would fix it, but they didn't. Character models are far from impressive by today's standard, and let's face it; the day of random encounters is long past. Games like Chrono Cross and Xenosaga have shown an encounter system that is a lot more fun. Battles in Skies can go for a very long time, but that doesn't mean they aren't fun. I just wish I could skip the opening animations for the battles.

 Despite the games flaws its still a fun story, with loveable and memorable characters. And the game play mechanics, while traditional and even clich' are still a lot of fun.

Wildlife Zoo's graphics are so much better and it seems like you have more to do (micromanaging). You have to grow certain food, build poulty farms for meat, and watch plants grow. I loved the thunderstorms that include rain and makes the skies a little dark. Seeing it snow and it sticking onto the ground was a welcome site; however one flaw which takes away from the realism of the game is that people who come into the park and are wearing shorts makes you think, ""huh"",  when the temperature shows that it's -2C. Hopefully a patch will fix that. But on another flaw of the game, on Dreamcatcher's website who published the North American version of Wildlife Park 2, used a weird extension on a patch that virtually makes it not downloadable. A flaw in the game shows up way too much because the animals eat and drink in the ""air"". There mouthes are not exactly in the water bowl or the food bowl yet they're actually eating and drinnking perspectivly. Both the shorts in the winter and animals eating and drinking in the air take away the realism. The animals in Zoo Tycoon 2 (and its expansions) are more realistic in the behaviors (eating, drinking, sleeping, playing with toys). Some people might be turned off by the lack of support by the publisher and the sense that the game was left for dead. You would think that if the game has terrible graphics and is totally a mess, that it would be left for dead. I believe this can be a great game if some polish is added (though not as bad as some other games) and some added content and expansions are added.

Mentioning both Wildlife Park 2 and Wildlike Zoo might confuse some people. Wildlife Zoo is Wildlife park 2's North American release is so much better than Wildlife Park. Wildlife Park 2 was released in Europe. I would rate this game a little higher than Zoo Tycoon 2 (a half star more)because of the graphics, how its presented, and the fact that nothing is recycled. If the 2 expansions of Wildlife Park 2 ever make it to Wildlife Zoo, then Dreamcather could have a hit, and a terrific game (if the bugs are fixed also). Now hen I say recycled, look at Zoo Tycoon and its expansion Marine Mania. Marine Mania was redone for zoo tycoon 2. Zoo Tycoon's latest (last year) expansion was a recycled Dino Digs expansion for the original Zoo Tycoon labeled Extinct Animals. Many kids like it but I was very disappointed as I was looking for new content and some fixes as well. Wildlife Zoo also seems to cater to both adults and kids. Zoo Tycoon 2 seems more geared towards kids but is great for adults ( I have it).

Basically in Wildlife Zoo, you are given tasks to run a zoo. I believe it has 20 campaigns with goals that you must complete. The first 3 campaigns are tutorials to help you with minor tasks and get you going. The game has a great tutorial which is not confusing and allows you to grasp the games concepts and pulls you in. They are very informative and don't push you but more along the lines of guiding you. If Wildlife Zoo comes out with expansions then I really see this game skyrocketing over Zoo Tycoon 2. For now it has a slight edge on ZT2.

By the way, for system requirements, it says P4 2.0GHZ and recommends P4 3.0GHZ, however I'm running it on an Intel Core2 Duo (e6300- 1.86GHZ) and it works without any coughs or hickups. If you can, get a system that has Intel Core2Duo. NOT INTEL CORE! These are 2 different processors. If you are interested in AMD processors just make sure it's at least a Dual Core processor. DO NOT run onboard video and/or sound. This can drain your systems resources and cause games to not run, or fail, act sluggish, or act strange. The prices have fallen on processors, video cards, RAM (system memory), and sound cards.

Please note: I don't work for Intel, AMD, Dreamcatcher, Microsoft, or any other company associated with this product! :)

Update: You might want to hold out on this one because Wildlife Zoo Deluxe Edition has been released. The Deluxe edition includes Wildlife Zoo and the expansion Marine World. This is the North American release of Wildlife Park 2. Wildlife Park 2's 2nd expansion was Marine World. Its first expansion was called Crazy Zoo which isn't available for Wildlife Zoo. I bought Wildlife Park 2 and its expansion Crazy Zoo by importing it. WP2 is the same as Wildlife Zoo. So basically, if you want Crazy ZOo, you have to get WP2 Gold edition. If you want the expansion Marine World you could buy Wildlife Zoo Deluxe Edition since Marine World for WP2 is unavailable here as well as from international sellers (the English/U.K. version. Wildlife Zoo Deluxe does have some bug fixes from Wildlife Zoo but it's still missing what could make it a hit. I will write a review for the Deluxe edition, soon.",More polished than Zoo Tycoon 2 and has the potential. It needs some work.,1160524800,40,,

You can get on the internet and play with your friends for free. Miis are fun to mess with. Also, as I've never been a stickler for graphics, I'm fine with the Wii's lesser capabilities.

I think its movement-based hardware is actually a good idea -- doesn't everyone lean into the motion of their characters every now and then? However, a lot of waggling and moving around gets old sometimes, and there's something to be said for a loss of accuracy while jumping around and aiming, etc. Thankfully, on some games you can use Gamecube controllers if you'd like to play traditionally, or if the waggling and flicking is annoying.

What stinks about the Wii, and what ultimately drags the score down, is its poor offering of games. Got Mario Galaxy, Paper Mario, Zelda, Mario Kart, Animal Crossing, and Super Smash Brothers Brawl? Great. Well... that's it. Unless you want to play heaps of insipid Flash-esque minigames, the system is ultimately a waste of time. It seems that most of Nintendo's heavy-hitters have already hit, and they usually come only once in a console's lifetime. I don't want to wait months and months for serious games. I want more third-party support and, knowing Nintendo, I don't think that's coming anytime soon. It appears to be geared toward small children and older people who like small, bite-sized diversions.

The games controls are tough to get a firm grasp on. I don't see this as a negative, though, I see it as a positive. Once you get a grasp of what you're doing, you really feel like Iron Man. The targetting doesn't suck, you have to hold down the weapons button and get the targeting reticle close to the target; Iron Man will lock on and do some damage.

Everything from the movie is here and then some. You can catch missles mid air and throw them at the enemy. You can grab helicopters, rip their tails off and watch them crash. You can jump onto tanks and rip the turrets off.

For Iron Man's weapons, he has repulsors(hand weapons), missles(from gauntlets:these get really fun when you get guided missles!), and Uni beam (blast from chest). Uni beam needs to be charged and can be fun to use, but it really is so much easier to rely on repulsors + missles since they can be used together.

One big hats of to the programmers for giving the ability to divert energy to specific abilities to increase their effectiveness. Need to catch up to some enemy jets? Divert energy to thrusters and stomp on em. Alot of enemys incoming? Divert energy to weapons to increase their power and minimize the amount of time shooting at them. Getting pummeled? Divert energy to life support to increase HP. This was a very well planned feature.

Graphics weren't bad but they could've done better on character faces. They did give Gwyneth(Pepper) a boob job so that was cool.

There is a feature that unlocks as you play the game called ""One Man Army"" which you have to kill 80 enemies in 10 minutes. It is in about 6 waves and if you complete each wave you are awarded with a new Iron Man armor. You can get armors from the original comics armor to the Hulkbuster Armor, which all have specific stat bonuses. I spent most of the time in the Classic Armor, which was my fav.

No, it wasn't all positive though. Some objectives were kinda confusing towards the end and the game, as a whole, was short. I unlocked all the armors and beat the game in one day (btw, you get Iron Man's ""Ultimate Armor"" for beating the game). So I can understand not wanting to shell out $60 bucks for this game, but I was happy to spend $20 on it.","A high learning curve, but once you know what you're doing . . .",1227484800,3,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

4.0,True,"02 16, 2013",A2UX76CO96BFX3,B005THAX5Q,A. D. Neal,"Before I give my review, I want to give a bit of background on my credentials for reviewing this game:
I am a veteran gamer with 70k Xbox gamer points. Since receiving the game on release day I have played through the campaign entirely on hardened, partially on ""ultimate badass"", and put in significant time in the multiplayer. The immediate flood of bad reviews after release I believe was partially due to the reviewers not having sufficiently played the game enough to adequately review it or being simply turned off by the dated graphics.
I am also not in any way affiliated with any of the companies that developed this game, as I know there are mercenary reviewers out there that write positive reviews professionally. Personally, I rarely take the time to review a product or game unless I feel strongly about it, and the flood of bad reviews I feel needed to be answered with a balanced and thoughtful response, so here it is.
I will also say that I have been waiting for this game for nearly three years, and pre-ordered it over two years ago, so I had high expectations going into it. With that said, I believe that it was worth the wait, and here is why.
First, let me address perhaps the biggest complaint: graphics. The graphics are dated to be sure, they are rather blocky and the first two missions aboard the Sulaco really highlight this disadvantage. The graphics are not terrible, they are just dated and might shock players more accustomed to games like Gears of War or Dead Space. At the same time, the lower end graphics allow for some pretty nice features: split-screen playing (which higher end graphics typically don't support, GoW excepted) for both campaign and multi and very smooth playing as the xenomorphs. For gamers familiar with the attempts at playing xenos in the past (e.g. AVP 1&2 on PC and the more recent X360 AVP) this is usually the most awkward part of the game, the simple reason being that running on walls and ceilings at high speed takes a toll on graphics and often the interface gets difficult to manage and confusing to play. However, A:CM does an excellent job with the xenomorph play, in fact I would say it is the most natural adaptation of xeno play for any game I have ever played, and that is saying a lot as I loved the old AVP 2. Further, the graphics are actually quite excellent during the darker missions, particularly in the Hadley's Hope colony where the lighting and darkness really highlight the excellent xenomorph physiology.
Ultimately, as the graphics go, if you are a player that is looking for graphics on par with other recent releases such as Dead Space 3, then you might want to look elsewhere. However, if you don't mind a bit of old-school graphics in exchange for smooth gameplay, then A:CM is for you.
Second, the weaponry is not quite as customizable as I would have hoped given Gearbox's role in production. The weapons are all pretty basic (three rifles, SMG, two shotguns, two pistols) but the custom options are quite nice if few overall, as they can change the underslung weapon (shotgun, grenades, etc) on the rifles, and offer additional fire features that you unlock as you progress in level. I also would have liked to see potential customization on the legendary weapons (found in single player and connected to characters from the film) as the custom options end up making the regular weapons more powerful than the legendary ones after enough power-ups. On the other hand, in comparison with other comparable games from the past, these features are far and beyond previous games and offer a nice variability in play. The xenomorph (multi) upgrades are great and really add a lot of variability to their play, including different kinds of attack for the three classes (soldier, spitter, runner/lurker), different armors, skill traits, and appearance options. Thus while the customized options could have gone further, for this sort of game they are sufficient and really add a lot to gameplay.
Third, as to the single player campaign it is long enough to be substantial without getting repetitive. You play through the Sulaco (the original Aliens ship), Hadley's Hope (the colony), the crashed alien ship (codenamed Origin), and a Wey-Yu research facility. In all, playing through first time on hardened (experienced players should go straight to hardened as it is a challenge without being ridiculous) I put in about 8 hours or so which is a little more than Dead Space 2 (which I had replayed at 6hrs just before receiving this title). My only gripes are rather minor overall. First, I would have liked to see the powerlifter integrated into play more. You utilize it once to open a door and once to fight a big nasty xeno, but that's it. Second, and more substantively (spoiler alert) the final level is just a boss fight with the queen but it is ultimately rather lame as all you do is run from her, pull switches, and then wait for her to get in the path of a loading dock mechanism which you use to catapult her out of the ship. Not all that difficult, just a bit frustrating, and overall not the grand finale I was expecting. On the other hand, four player drop-in co-op (reminiscent of L4D games) is great and makes the ""ultimate badass"" difficulty (which is great) more feasible (by the by, hardened gamers will appreciate the lack of a HUD in the badass difficulty which adds an extra element of difficulty to the mix and makes the laser sight option all the more valuable).
Fourth, as I indicated earlier, the multiplayer is great. The marines and aliens are very well balanced and the four game modes are all great and offer significant modifications to play. The team deathmatch makes the aliens a little tougher so they can go toe-to-toe with the marines while the other three modes beef up the marines by allowing for teammates to revive fallen comrades while the aliens take significantly less damage (equal to single player). This makes for a great swarm feeling as the aliens throw themselves at the marines who try to stick together while achieving objectives of the game mode (destroying egg clusters in extermination, moving through a series of waypoints in escape, or fortifying an area against attack in survivor). All of the game modes are great and I really can't decide on a favorite. As I mentioned before, the lower graphics really aid in smooth gameplay in the multi, particularly for the xenos who are played from the third person perspective and have enhanced vision to be able to see all other players while the marines have their motion detectors. The effect is grand as both sides are trying to hunt the other and gameplay comes off as very natural and balanced. Aliens tend to try and surround the marines while the marines cluster together for survival (lone marines are an easy target generally).
In conclusion, this game is limited graphically but the limitations generally end there. Considering that this was supposed to be released a year ago (and that was after a long development) it is clear that Gearbox made the right choice by pushing back release in order to fine tune the gaming experience. The multi is among the best that I have ever played and for those that enjoy playing as aliens, this is THE game for you. I am also super excited that Gearbox has already launched the season pass meaning they will be releasing four DLC packs. I was worried due to the bad reviews that the game wouldn't get this support, but thankfully Gearbox is supporting it regardless and fans of the game, myself now included, are extremely grateful for their support and I look forward to the DLC releases.

UPDATE
Despite the general angst still being spilled over this game, I continue my support of it and the fact that I have had no issues playing online with plenty of full games shows that others are enjoying it as well. But I have discovered one point of annoyance which lowers my estimation of the game somewhat. At the time of writing this review I had only played split-screen co-op, but when I set down to play multiplayer with my wife we were dismayed to discover that there is no split-screen online compatibility (which would be great if they patched this but I find that doubtful). This means that the only split-screen support is for co-op campaign, no online campaign (as in you can't play with others online while playing split-screen) and no multiplayer, which greatly saddens me as I find the multiplayer to be one of the best I have ever played (I find most multiplayer games to be rather dull and unbalanced). As such, I will be purchasing a second copy of this game so my wife and I can play online (as we do with most online multiplayer games as very few have splitscreen capabilities) once it drops in price but I thought I would update my experience to forewarn those that expect (as I did) that the split-screen capability includes online play, which it does not.","If you can get beyond the graphics, this game is amazing",1360972800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4.0,False,"03 16, 2013",A2Z87Y25MSZFZ7,B007FTE2VW,A.W.,"Unlike many others, I decide to hold off my review until I actually got a good feel for this game.  Received the game 3/8 and had almost a week of playing time.  I've logged over 30 hours so far!  I'm definitely enjoying it.

Overall, I'm very impressed this with game.

 A lot of complex ways to build a city.  You have several different specializations are well (Oil, mining, gambling, tourism, and hi tech industries).  Have one city in the region be a Las Vegas, the next a Houston with large oil refineries, then the next a Silcon Valley.

The region mode is a major plus and quite brillant.  I hadn't tried multiplayer yet, but after starting my 3rd city in my region, you can see why it's appealing option.  The idea is that one city can't have it all and that you'll need to trade and specialize.  Currently I have one city specialize in oil, another with a university, and I'm starting on one that will specialize with Ore and Alloy.  It's a pretty sweet concept to have one city that's completely industrialized, producing many jobs.  Then the next city over a modern suburb and having residents commute over.  I wanted to explain all this because I'm seeing many complaints that the cities are too small and can be built up in an hour.  That could be true that's the case, but where's the creativity?  Where's the heart and style?  Did you specialize?  Sure you can build a plain city that quickly, but you're missing the point of the game.

Now onto the negative side of this game.  I didn't think having an online only in SimCity was a big deal like others were making it out to be, especially with the fact that you can privatize your regions.  However EA only lived to that hype by having the servers overload and crash the first two days of release of the game, so bad it made national news.  It's the reason why you see 3000 reviews on Amazon currently, yet only 1.5 stars rating average.

At the moment, the game has been dumbed down.  Cheetah mode isn't enabled, I can't send money to other cities in my region, leadership boards turned off.  While I know EA and Maxis will fix their errors eventually, I hope in the future they realize that these DRM games won't work unless they truly invest in providing the infrastructure for their fans.  That said, I am

There are a couple negatives in terms of actually gameplay.

The biggest one is the traffic system is a complete nightmare once you start to reach a population past 50k.  Maxis addresses this in their strategy guide by saying design roads differently by watching for clogs, add expensive transportation infrastructure and I mean expensive!  One of my cities reached a population of 150K and the city was pretty much shut down due to major traffic delays.  I added buses, streetcars, more roads.  In the end I had over cots of 10000/hr invested into my mass transportation and no improvement in traffic flow, with my overall budget looking grim thanks to the increased costs.  I ended up destroying my entire city by leveling every building with the help of unleashing a giant lizard!!  Then I decreased road size in neighborhoods to limit the density in the city.  The city now sits at 60k and traffic has been much improved.  Seems silly to see Maxis set challenges for people to have a population of 2.5 million when I can barely survive with a city with 100K.

Why is traffic congestion such a problem?  On a micro level, when traffic starts to pile up you can see 1-3 cars blocking an entire intersection when hundreds of cars could of easily gone thru in another direction.  Maxis can blame the users for not understanding traffic flow, but it's clear there's a fundamental problem with this and I hope a update will eventually address.

The only other one I have an issue with so far is residents commuting between regions.  In my 2nd city, I have nearly 1000 people unemployed as I set it to be a suburb/college town.  Yet only half of that population with commute to the next city over, my oil town, which has nearly 5000 job postings.  What gives?  I setup regional trains and buses, yet no one will do the drive over to the next city.  Isnt that the point of regional play?  I'm hoping it's just a bug related with the server issues they are still working on.

Overall though, I love this game.  It's the best city builder out there by far and I'm hoping fixes and the eventual expansion packs make it even better.  Feel I'll log at least 100 hours easily by the end of the month and I definitely recommend it.  Don't let the 3000 negative reviews defer you from buying this game.  1500 were made at the same of the release and based purely on emotion.  People have every right to be upset at EA, I agree, but I feel many people will miss out on a great game if they solely looked just at the avg review this game currently sits at.","Has a lot of promise, it's a shame that EA really stumbled with the release.",1363392000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4.0,False,"05 20, 2015",A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0017Q4DGI,Mark Baker - Carstairs Considers,"Usually, when Nintendo releases a new video game system, they bundle their newest Mario game with it.  That's why I was shocked to learn that the bundled game for the Wii was Wii Sports.  The first time I played it, however, I understood why.  This game really shows off what the Wii can do.

In case you've missed it, the Wii's controllers, called a Wiimote, are unlike anything you've seen before.  Yes, they do have buttons and a control pad area to move players around traditionally.  But they are motion sensitive.  The whole idea of this system is that you can swing the remote and affect what happens on the screen.  Considering I've been trying to do that unsuccessfully for years, is it any wonder I love this system?

So, for Wii Sports, instead of sitting down and hitting buttons, you are up on your feet swinging your arm to get the characters move.  And yes, you can tell the machine you are left handed, and it responds accordingly.  It's surprisingly fun.  There are five games here, although I tend to stick to three of them.

Tennis - This is the first game I ever played on a Wii, and it's a blast.  You're playing doubles, so you can play with up to four people at a time.  Or, if you've got less than that, the computer will fill in for the missing players.  You don't have any control over the movement of your characters.  The only thing you control is your swing.  By timing it correctly, you can hit the ball back to your opponent or just by him.  Personally, I like the fact that I just have to concentrate on when to swing and let the computer move me around.  Only rarely does it fail me.  Usually, when I mess up, it's because I miss timed a swing or my opponent returned it to a spot I'd have no hope of reaching no matter who controlled the movement.  You can play a match of 1, 3, or 5 sets, so it never takes too long.

Bowling - I love to bowl, so it's no surprise that I love this game; in fact, it's my favorite.  And it's really simple.  Just swing the Wiimote and let go of the B button to release the ball.  Here's where the game gets fun, however.  The Wiimote senses any curve of spin you put on the ball as well as how quickly you were going when you released it.  While I tend to throw it straight like I do in real life, you can get some wicket spin on it.  Again, you can play with any number of people from one to four, but since you bowl one at a time, you can all share one Wiimote for this game.

Golf - There's nothing like a nice day on the greens, right?  Well, if it's raining out, you can play 3 or 9 holes on the comfort of your living room.  This time around, press and hold the A button and then swing the golf club like a bowling ball.  You only need one Wiimote no matter how many people are playing, and you can play by yourself or with up to three friends.  When it comes time to putt, this one can get frustrating because it doesn't recognize small swings.  I often find the small putts are the hardest because no matter how I swing I hit them too hard.

My brother and I had Golf for the original Nintendo.  He pointed out to me that the holes here are identical to the ones from that old game.  Just a fun bit of trivia for you for free.

Baseball - It's you versus one friend or the computer as you battle it out over three innings.  When it's your turn to bat, you swing your Wiimote just like a bat.  Pitching?  Hit a button on the plus pad of the Wiimote and then swing it down.  Once the ball is in the air, however, you can't do anything but cheer on your fielders to make an out or your runners to get on base.  I find this one fun if I'm playing it with a friend, but against the computer it gets boring quickly.  I have had roommates who will play this one by themselves by the hour, however.

Boxing - This is the only sport in this game that requires the Nunchuck, an additional controller for the Wii.  Don't worry, you don't have to learn to control anything.  Instead, you hold the Wiimote in one hand and the Nunchuck in the other and go to town swinging at your computer opponent or your friend.  You can jab, punch, or block.  While I can break a sweat playing Tennis, you are pretty much guaranteed to start sweating if you play this for any length of time.  Who says you can't get a go workout playing a video game?

While this game is most fun when you play it against someone, they give you a challenge by yourself as well.  After each round, you are given a ranking based on how well you did.  If you did better than last time, you climb.  If you did worse, you fall.  The goal is to reach 1000 points and become a pro.  Sadly, you can lose that status if your ranking slips below 1000.  It's amazing how quickly you can lose any skill you have with the game.  After not playing it for a while, I find I start losing status quickly.  Bowling and Golf update your status any time since those are truly solo endeavors.  The others won't update if you are playing against or with your friends.  And your computer opponent keeps getting harder the higher your ranking climbs, too.

Those looking for highly realistic graphics should look elsewhere.  The graphics are cartoony by design.  In fact, you use the Mii you can create on the machine.  This cartoon version of yourself is the character you actually control for all these games.  The environments do look nice, but even they won't blow you away with their detail.

Likewise, the sound isn't going to blow you away.  There is minimal music; it's mostly sound effects of you grunting or the ball being wacked.  It gets the point across, and it matches the game.  Frankly, that's all I'm looking for.

The games themselves getting tiring?  There are some fun minigames that let you ""train"" for the big games.  My favorite of these is in bowling where they start you with the traditional 10 pins but keep adding a row of pins for every frame after that.  A precursor to the 100 pin bowling in Wii Sports Resort, I guess.

Wii Sports will get you up and moving, showing what this new system can do.  And it is a great game to play with any number of friends.  It's the anti-video game.",What Better Way to Show Off the New Wii System Than with Wii Sports?,1432080000,,,

I have played nearly half of the campaign and a few minutes multiplayer. The new dog fight mode(DFM) disappointed me at first but later I found it really exciting. Compared to previous which generally you have to fly behind enemy jets' butts and fire missles, DFM requires many little moves to shoot down them. It is not as easy and boring as many of you may think. The thing I don't like is in this mode you have to shoot 3-4 missles to shoot down an enemy jet. And even a lot more to down a bomber.
The sound track is ok. I do love some of them. PS: Veterans all know that ZERO is a legend.

CONS: The traditional fight style can no longer shoot down elite targets. Some special weapons are weakened. The control is a little bit weird and not smooth compared to previous AC games.
The story is boring since a lot of games have already dealt with Russians. It is a trial to set the background into real world but I do wish the next AC game will return to the world which 4,5,0 have used.

I have been playing harvest moon games since I was about 9 and I just fell in love with them. When i first heard about this game I started looking it up on any site I could find and I thought that it looked like a very good, more improved version of TOT (tree of tranquility). My mom bought it for me almost as soon as it was released and I spent about one hour playing it. During the time that I was playing I found a few cons but a lot of pros :).

Pros:
the graphics are amazing! I went back and compared animal parade and tree of tranquility and I saw an amazing difference between the two.

You can have 2 kids :D! We all know what 2 kids mean (or at least what it means to me) MORE GIFTS ON YOU B-DAY!!! XD

Your spouse and children are helpful!!!!! 0o0 You can send your kids and your husband/wife out to work for you! they can water your crops, take care of your animals, fish, mine and forage!!! No more lazing around for them :D!

New people 0o0 a new guy that you can marry as well as a new girl (the wizard X3 and the witch).

You can marry the harvest goddess as well as the brand new harvest god!

It's also really easy to befriend the animals in AP unlike in TOT.

Cons:
Less land to grow one and buying new ones costs you an arm and a leg :/.

It's a lot harder to get money and everything cost a LOT more then in TOT.

It's harder to befriend people and also their tastes have changed and most of the stuff that they just like is a pain in the butt to get. Trying to give them something that they love is almost impossible.

Want easy house expansions? Well sorry your out of luck X(. just the first house expansion costs roughly about 10 to 20 thousand and since it's so hard to get just 5 thousand it takes forever to get enough money.

Good luck trying to revive the goddess tree. Before you can revive the tree you have to revive the harvest god and you know how you do that? You have to go and sell a certain amount of ores, fish, plants etc and you have to get the high quality stuff so that by the end of the month you have around 1 million buck from fishing, mining, growing etc.

I got enough fish to revive him and so I stopped fishing and went to mining cause I love to mine :). at the end of the month I had about 3 thousand bucks in ore and roughly about 30 thousand in fish 0-0. Guess what happened for no reason. it counted my mining for the gathering of the month! I lost a whole month of fishing to that! I'm not sure if it was a glitch or what but I just said ""No...just no."" and put up the game. haven't played it since D:<

Ellis,"I've heard many times that the most off-putting aspect of Killer 7--the on-rail shooting, that is--""would probably be unbearably irritating."" Admittedly, that was my initial complaint. However, after going out on a limb and making the purchase, I quickly found myself forgetting all about that aspect of it: in fact, it truly adds to, not detracts from, the game, and Killer 7 does not feel limited whatsoever.

For those who are not shy about their adoration for next-gen. console titles like ""Fallout 3,"" where the open possibilities are endless and old-school gamers inevitably get inexplicably lost (or irritated that the plot has not advanced in hours), this game surely cannot be for you. Instead, Killer 7 is artistic, clever, and has something to say, which can only be detracted from by adding nuisances which the on-rail shooting evades.

That aspect of it has got to be the only potential ""weakness"" of it, though. Awesome cell shading, good voice acting, and incredible characters (which I believe accounts for the ""cult"" following Killer 7 has garnered) are among a few strong points of this non-traditional title. As a side note, the shooting procedure might take a couple seconds of getting used to, but once you understand it, it will indefinitely enhance your playing experience.

All-in-all, I've played a LOT of games over the last two decades, but this is my number one favorite.

It doesn't feel like it'll snap like cheaper headsets, and the microphone comes through clearly on the other side! Lots of features, I especially like the ability to hear yourself talking, which I was afraid would have a delay and be like an echo, but instead just feels like I'm not wearing the headset with how clear I can hear my own voice as I speak (with NO delay!) and if you don't like it you can just turn down that separate volume wheel!

The headset works on my PS3, Xbox 360, and even my PS4! With the PS4 you just plug the headset directly into the Dualshock 4 controller rather than into the amp, and it plays all game sound and lets you chat with other players! Really nice and removes all the cords, creating a semi-wireless headset if you carry your controller with you to, say, the kitchen to grab a drink.

The game audio also sounds fantastic, and while it isn't surround sound, it feels a bit like it. I can tell when footsteps are behind me or when an explosion is coming from in front of me, but off to the left, for example. No hissing, static, or anything else! You can customize the sound through the amp, which has options for microphone audio (hearing yourself), chat audio (other players/your friends' volume), and game audio (anything coming through the console). There is also a wheel for bass, treble, and a switch that goes through on/off and two other options I'm not entirely sure of what they do, but I believe they are for when you use the headset with a phone.

Combat in this game takes skill [no button smashing allowed].  You start out as a sword/shield or staff fighter.  To succeed, you have to learn how to timely block enemy attacks and strike when an opening occurs.  I understand this might be a negative for some, but once you grasp the combat mechanics, it makes for a very fun game!

There are 2 main factions you can choose to join, and 3 main classes [fighters to mage].  Risen also includes an upgrade tree that allows one to create hybrid classes.
The game world is vast and atmospheric.  Monsters/Enemies are varied [although repeated], characters [like ArcaniA] can be bland to look at and are often repeated.
Recently beat the game, took 40 hours for my first play through.

I wrote a previous review where I claim ArcaniA is a decent game [which I stand by]; but I can now say Risen is the superior game of the two [in terms of presentation, gameplay and story].  Other games worth comparing to are: Divinity 2 - Dragon Knight SAGA and of course the older Gothic series.

If your looking for an RPG similar to Dragon Age Origins [where you act as the combat strategist giving orders], then you may want to steer away from Risen.  But if you want an RPG that requires the user to participate in combat in a real-time scenario, then Risen may be a game you'll enjoy!

5.0,True,"09 7, 2011",A3NWDVRYFBV72W,B00005Q8LR,Scottypiper,"I never played this during the GameCube era, but I picked it recently and played through it.

Story: From what I gather, Luigi wins a contest that awards him a mansion. Mario has been kidnapped by King Boo and you must find and rescue him in the mansion.

Gameplay: Action/Adventure game. You go through a mansion trying to turn on the light in each room by trapping ghosts in your Poltergust 3,000 (a vacuum). Your vacuum has 2 options, suck and blow. When trying to capture ghosts, they have a number on them and you must get that number down to zero before they will be sucked in. Once a ghosts is in the vacuum's stream (first by stunning them with the flashlight), you need to rotate the control stick to the opposite way the ghost is facing. Most of the main ghosts you have to discover a way to startle them to start the process. It may be opening a window, catching them when they are distracted, rocking a chair, etc. Each has a special way to take them down and it is a lot of fun trying to figure it out. You also get special vacuum powers later on such as fire, water, and ice. Each is used to clear certain rooms in the game. To continue through the mansion, you must find keys to unlock new doors. Once a key is found, you can check the map to see what door it opens. You also have the ability to scan ghosts to see a hint at their weakness. As you travel through the mansion, you will also get a boo meter in the game that helps track down the boos. You can't get into the last room without trapping all the boos first. The boos have a number by them and you have to follow them room to room until you capture them.

Conclusion: Graphics are good for the GameCube. Controls are easy. The game is probably 3-5 hours. It was longer than I thought and a few of the ghosts are pretty tough to capture/figure out. Worth getting if you still have a GameCube or even a Wii since the Wii will play EVERY GameCube title.",Still good even after the Gamecube's era is passed,1315353600,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Despite how some people complaining about the graphics on KOF not being current gen, but it looks great to me. I am coming from playing GGXRD and Blazblue which both are very different from KOF, BB being 2D and GGXRD in between 2D/3D-ish. The KOF character animations were smooth, the music was good, the backgrounds were actually quite amazing [if you have a second to take a look].

I go through the tutorial like I usually do with any fighter - then dove right into the story to check out the gameplay. Picked 3 characters and got rolling. Quickly realized i need to do some training  with characters because i don't know their commands. I got through the story with relative ease with my initial 3 characters. Then ran a second play through with a random set, which i knew nothing about either. But it looks like it'll be fun to know the technical of each character in training and dive into some ranking matches soon. There are different offline play modes like missions, training, story and player data to keep track of your records.

As of this moment without trying the online content of the game yet is enough to make me recommend the game.

The keyboards with the screens, fancy lights, and macro keys look good but a lot of people don't know or don't care that these keyboards use up some of your system memory because of the programs they run.  As games become more and more memory intensive, I don't want my system memory wasted on a keyboard.  Most games will allow you to make macros using the existing keys so you don't need those extra macro keys at all.

This keyboard is great!  I love the way the keys feel.  They are really easy on your fingers and that is wonderful if you play as many hours as we do.

The BEST thing about this keyboard is that you can use many keys at the same time.  For example...I hit two buff keys, two or three potion keys, and my weapon style...all at the same time!

For those confused, a platformer is like just about any mario game (super mario, mario 64 ect)  You basically have an action game that requires you to kill things (in a fun way) and jump from this platform to the next avoiding obstacles and enemies along the way.  These are some of the most creative games in the history of video games.  In my opinion they are also some of the most fun.  Fun creative action games, what more could you ask for.

The tracks are the usual mix of 16 new and 16 ""reimagined"" older courses. You have the usual offerings of 50, 100, and 150cc plus mirror courses. The tracks are suitably challenging and fun on replay which is definitely a good thing since you're going to be replaying these a lot if you want a three star rating. Getting that top rating seems a little more difficult and demanding than on console versions, but that just adds to the challenge.

The one gripe I have with the game is that to unlock all of the parts you're pretty much forced into online racing. The online experience isn't bad. In fact it's quite fun and a vast improvement over the DS version where it was hacked to hell and back and you were left high and dry if you weren't a snaking expert with jedi reflexes. It's just that unlocking the top tier Kart parts becomes a joyless exercise in grinding rather than a display of skill in this version.

5.0,True,"10 5, 2009",A3S3R88HA0HZG3,B002BS47JE,PT Cruiser,"Wii Fit Plus, that is!  I couldn't wait to try this new title because I enjoy and use the first one so much. When you start it up, the Plus goes and gets all your info and stats from the older version and brings them right into the game, so you can continue right where you left off, but with lots of new games and features.  This is well worth the $20 just for the 15 new games.

There are lots of nice new features with this Wii Fit Plus.  I always wished I could set up routines instead of having to move from one menu to the next after each exercise, or that there were ready made routines that I could follow involving several exercises.  With the Plus this is possible.  You start in the locker room and select from Wii Fit Plus Routines, My Routine, or the Favorites menu.  You go to another screen to decide what parts of your body or what type of goals you want to pursue and the difficulty level and length of time.  Then the system will set up a routine designed just for you and your goals.  I think it's much more efficient to go through exercises this way.  You can also compare how you did each day and how much you're improving.  There's a multiplayer mode so that more than one person can play, but you do have to take turns.  Still, it's nice to not have to 'log out' each time a different person wants to play.

Another new feature is that you can add babies or pets to the Plus.  I have a big fat long haired 'mini' dachshund that was too embarrassed to be weighed today, but that pupper is going to get weighed tomorrow!  They don't get to do body tests or play any games, but you can keep track of their weight and record it in their stats.  Useful?  Well, maybe not so much but big points for the cuteness factor.

I love the games because it's such a great way to get exercise without even realizing it and the 15 new ones in this title are just as good as the old if not better than the first edition.  Want to learn to walk and chew gum at the same time?  One of these games will have you balancing on a big red and white striped ball (your Wii Fit board) while juggling smaller balls thrown to you by your assistants.  Or how about Rhythm Parade where you march and raise and lower your hands on cue and in time with the music?  Tilt City has you using your Wiimote turned sideways and the balance board to maneuver dropping balls into one of three color coordinated pails.  It's easy at first, but when several different colored balls start dropping at once, it's a challenge.  I love the balance games and if you're a fan of the balance board game with the little balls in the first game, there's one here that uses some different colored slots to ""pop"" the balls up over small obstacles and into the hole.  You control their movement by leaning in different directions on the balance board.

There are also 3 new yoga activities and 3 new strength training activities.  That's not to say that some of the games don't improve strength and muscles.  There is one game where you flap your arms like wings to fly from one target post to another over water to get points on each one.  This is one where you want to draw all the curtains because you'll look completely ridiculous standing there on your balance board wildly flapping your arms like some kind of a crazy bird.  But you won't believe how tired your arm muscles feel afterward and you don't even notice while you're busy flying from one target to another.  There's another game, Island Cycling, where you step on the balance board to simulate pedaling a bike, trying to pass Wii flags where you accumulate points.  You steer with the Wiimote held sideways.  I was surprised how sore my calves were afterward, trying to control the speed of the bike.

When you can get exercise while doing something that's challenging and fun without even realizing that you're exercising, that's a successful game.  That's why I bought the Wii to begin with and this game takes full advantage of the balance board and all the interactive features.  Can I walk and chew gum at the same time after playing these games?  Well, maybe not yet but I can bust big blue and white balloons by running into them with my Segway on a beach and get almost halfway through the course inside a big ol' bubble in Balance Bubble Plus.

5.0,True,"06 12, 2013",A3S9DOTT4Z8JF9,B005MY2E5S,Amozarte,"Ignore the negative reviews, this product is well worth the ~$15 asking price (as of this writing).  It is, in my opinion, the best grip currently available for the 3DS.  Judging by the average rating of only 3 1/2 stars, you may be wondering if I'm smoking something.  I can assure you I'm not.

I purchased this product in February 2013 (you can check my ""Amazon verified purchase"" status below, if you don't believe me) and I love it so much that my 3DS only ever leaves the grip at times when I don't plan to actually *play*  it and want to save some space- like when I'm StreetPass hunting at the mall, for example.

Let me start by dealing with the primary complaint of negative reviews- the ""faulty"" power feature.  Apparently some folks experienced a defect where the grip wouldn't charge the 3DS properly, or would cause a screen flicker.  Apart from a very brief hiccup when I plugged it in for the first time, I've never power/charging issues.  The 3DS attaches to the grip firmly, holds tightly, and charges as expected.  If I had to guess, I'd say there was a bad batch at some point in the past, and that the manufacturer has since resolved the issue.

Now, if you're considering this grip you might also be considering&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CTA-Digital-s-slightly-cheaper-9-99-alternative/dp/B004MKN3YE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CTA Digital's slightly cheaper ($9.99) alternative</a>.  I'm going to give you a few reasons why you should buy the powered grip instead- even if you are still needlessly worried about the mythical charging issues described by other reviewers.

First, the non-powered grip has a slot for an extra SD card while the powered grip has a slot for an extra game cartridge.  When considering whether I'd rather bring along an extra SD card or an extra game cart, I'm pretty sure the answer is going to be an extra game 100% of the time.  But even if you've bought the entire 3DS Shop and somehow managed to need a second SD card, here's a pro-tip: an SD card is smaller than a game cart.  If your powers of deductive reasoning are working, you will undoubtedly have realised that the powered grip lets you carry an SD card OR a game!  Elementary, my dear Watson!

Second, the powered grip has a battery.  Even if that battery is faulty or isn't charged, it adds weight to the grip.  Just the right amount of weight so that the 3DS + powered grip combo feels perfectly balanced in my adult hands.  (As it happens, the whole assembly looks and feels almost exactly like an Xbox controller.)  The non-powered grip has no battery, and therefore feels just a touch too light with the 3DS attached.

Really, the only thing I could even suggest to the manufacturer is to offer it in more colours.  I'm personally a fan of all things black, but given that Nintendo has dramatically increased system sales by offering additional colour choices, I'd venture a guess that the person who bought a pink 3DS might be more willing to spring for this accessory if it were colour-matched.

Apart from that I can't say enough positive things about the CTA Digital Power Grip.  If you had any hesitations about purchasing, throw them out the window, get out your credit card, and click ""add to cart"" right now.  You won't be sorry!",Basically perfect,1370995200,,,

No Pokmon game will replace my love for Sapphire, because it holds a special place in my heart and it is my favorite, but objectively, I think this (Black or White 2) is the best in the series.

This game has all the ingredients for a perfect Pokmon game. It has great music (Gym leader battle theme and Rival battle theme); even the gyms themselves have personalized themes that play as you battle your way through on your search for the gym leader. It has a great plot that reveres your old player character in BW1 as some hero, like Red in Gold and Silver, except with more importance, has a great, albeit cookie-cutter Pokmon ""Hero vs Villian"" plot where Ghetsis has anger management issues and takes all his anger towards Hilbert/Hilda on you. I won't spoil it. It has great graphics (the same as BW1), great post-story adventures to enjoy, challenge, a wide assortment of Pokmon, with almost half of the entire Pokmon collection as the new Reigonal Unova Dex. Lemme talk about this for a second, and I could save you some time when playing.

This game has so many Pokmon. SO. MANY. This a good thing, but only if you chose the right Pokmon. Riolu is available extremely early in the game. I jumped all over this since Lucario is an excellent Pokmon, as well as my favorite personally. I don't know what the developer's problem is, because this game is INCREDIBLY hard to play with him. Every Pokmon here and there has Earthquake, which is super effective against Steel type Lucario and his low HP ass and will KO him in one hit. Everything else has acrobatics and such to damage fighting types (my favorite) like Emboar, which I also use. If you use fighting types, beware. This game gon' give you hell.

5.0,False,"02 9, 2009",A3UVENWAZNJ8EK,B000X1TC0U,Easy L,"Okay, so you're the lone hero who doesn't talk, not a soldier (instead engineer), has a long-lost love interest, has lethal mining equipment, is stranded on a metal casket of a ship, and there's blood hungry alien type things that just killed your squad...in the opening sequence.  What did we learn?  Apparently, that's the way to introduce you into a traumatic 'fight or flight' hellacious story, is to just literally throw you into it.  But this is one of those games where you're not just screwed repeatedly and have to retry the opening (or any really) sequence over and over.  Dead Space does very good work at giving you a tutorial in an intense situation without making you panic...too much.  But that's the point of the game, inducing panic.  Almost the entire time you are in some very dark, narrow corridor.  The visuals are amazing, even though you can't see most of anything most the time anyway.

The story is decent but not great, just enough to keep you somewhat interested.  You're stuck pretty much trying to get off the Ishumura (the vessel you're stranded on) whilst surviving.  In the mix of all that, you start uncovering why and how the entire crew of the Ishumura disappeared.  And you're trying to find your lost girlfriend who, don't ya know, works on the only ship to be overrun by alien lifeforms.  Dead Space's story is relatively simple compared to most other survival-horror types out there, such as: Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Run Like Hell, Extermination, and the like.

The gameplay is simply outstanding, although you'll feel extremely claustrophobic, you'll never feel weighed down by lame controls that you're forced to endure.  The controls are very smooth compared to all the other similar games out there, very fluent.  There's the aim and fire, moving freely while aiming, two different melee attacks, a quick-heal shortcut button, sprint, shortcuts for weapons, and strafing.  There's absolutely no HUD either.  Not that I'm tired of looking at a fixed corner of text and colored bars, but the no HUD thing frees up a little screen room.  Your health, oxygen, and telekinesis bars are located on your back in plain view of you, the player.  Your pertinent data screens, such as inventory, maps, notes, special items, etc. are displayed in real time in front of Isaac (your character) as if he was physically looking at the projection himself.  Each weapon has 2 firing modes: primary, secondary.  And there's a weapon, armor, and abilities upgrade system along with a store to buy, sell, and store items and ammo.

Sound is key in this game.  The reason being is you get most of your environmental cues from sound.  Dead Space bests where a lot of games fail in this area.  You'll hear creatures climbing through vents and explosions sound like explosions for example.  The best thing about space is that there is absolutely no sound in space and there will instances where you'll experience this and probably fall in love with it.  Or hate it.  Up to you.

Now, the prime reason you will love, hate, fear, loath, and appreciate this game is simple:  GORE.  Gruesome, yet beautiful, the shear amount of blood and guts in game is the more in Dead Space than I've seen in the rest of my game library combined.  Its truly amazing really.  This makes the game.  Where Dead Space has any shortcomings, they are all forgiven and overlooked when you make that first blood fountain out of some poor necromorph's stubs by making it a bilateral amputee.  This is the reason we watch horror movies and play shooter games, for the GORE.  So join the GORE CORPS by assisting Isaac in his unforgettable endeavor to slice and dice as many unliving creatures as he can.",First time in years I've been scared like this,1234137600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

On comparisons to Oblivion; Oblivion is a better pure fantasy RPG.  All of the elements of an infinite fantasy universe are there in Oblivion, but Mass Effect has the right combination of third person shooter, RPG, and story.

+ Too many to detail
+ Loved that you actually have to make critical decisions (e.g. which character will be left to die)
+ Best cinematics and story I have seen in a game

Cons:
+ Friendly AI is worthless (but most games have worthless friendly AI)

You'll definitely want to play this a second time through, choosing paths opposite to the ones you initially chose in the first round.

This model is superior to the other models in many ways, the key one is that it offers HARDWARE based backwards compatibly(It basically has a PS2 inside the PS3) that plays over 99% of games (not 100% like some people will say) The PS3 can also 'upscale' PS1 and PS2 games, on some PS2 games the graphical difference will be very minimal, on other it will be a big step up, On PS1 games it will eliminate a lot of the 'jaggies' that are apparent in a lot of the 3D games.

Like I mentioned earlier, The 60&20GB offer 99%BC Only one game in my PS2 collection did not work, that one being Orphen. I have experienced some minor trouble with PS1 games but they are just minor graphical hiccups that don't affect the game in anyway.

Good games for the PS3 have been few and far between for awhile, but this years line up seems to be promising for the PS3 (white knight story,Final Fantasy Versus 13-to name a few) However I wish there were more exclusives to the PS3 to justify it higher price (why buy a $400-$500 system with the same games as the $300 system? -c'mon Sony get your act together!)

Another cool feature of the PS3 is it allows you to change the HDD yourself (does not void warranty) It uses a laptop HDD and can support the biggest size available at the moment 500GB!!

Firmware updates for the PS3 have been somewhat of a nightmare for Sony with the 2.40+ versions, There forum has a lot of upset people who have to pay $150 to get there system fixed because a FW update has crashed there system. My recommendation would be to download the updates to a flash drive and then update the PS3 via the flash drive as people who have been getting crashed all download Via the PS3...

Well thats about all I have to say for now, overall this is a very good system although the older 60&20GB models command a much higher price now, I'd say your best alternative would be to get a 80GB BC model it uses software to play the PS2 games witch lets you play 97% of PS2 games (no longer in production but are cheaper than the 60gig model)",The Way Sony's PS3 Was Meant To Be,1273881600,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

Kingdom Hearts 2 takes place 1 year after the events from the original game and this game doesn't dissapoint. ONe thing that is going to be obviously when u first play the game is that there is a new hero name Roxas. Roxas is actually the half of Sora(the main character) and he is trying to figure out why these weird dreams and questionable events are happening to him. THE BEGIINING of the game is kind of slow at first until u pick up a keyblade be cause the begining of the story with Roxas is a 3 hour tutorial of all the things ur gonna run into in the game. I'm not gonna spoil da story but this game is way superior to the original.

First of all is the UNBELEIVABLE battle system which is 5x better then da first. The basic Magic and regular atacks are there but there is something called a DRIVE system which allows Sora to transform into a twice as better fighter. Another thing is being able to weild two keyblades, this was an amazing surprise because it was so much fun and much faster to kill when u have two keyblades. ALSO i cannot forget about the new Action command with the triangle button, a much faster way to talk to people ,open up chests, and counter measurement combos. The only thing I didn't like about was the summoning spells-Stitch and Chicken Little I mean nobody cares about these disney characters let alone having an important role such as this in the game.

The Music is doned by the one and only Utada Hikaru, which once again comes up with an amazing theme/ending song that is both fitting and satisfying for the game. The orchestra is also breathtaking to the wonderful music for Hollow Bastion to the light hearted beat for Twilight Town. Also the other thing that is upgraded is the Gummi Ship thing. Unlike the first one which was frustrating and a real annoyance, this one is very fun in fact. The battle system is extremely fast at times that it is so confusin yet very authentic. Square Enix was planning to make this more than another mini game, but actually part of the game perse'.

THE STORY IS NOT OVER YET

-Encounter even more Disney heroes and villians

-Travel to amazing worlds you've never experienced

-Use powerful new techniques, magic and combination attacks

-EWxperience and adventure larger and deeper than before

First, Isaac now talks! Yes! No more mute Isaac. Also, the camera sensitivity is now faster than the first. I realized this cause its veeeeery sensitive. At least if you get spooked you will be able to react faster, lol. Much better audio/graphics, 1080i. As for Isaac there are a few added interactions, like the voice, he can also stomp like crazy which can be fun. One thing I didn't like was the online pass.. seriously, you have to buy the package to play online? Are you F'n serious? How many games out there come with online gameplay? The far worst part of the game.. I shouldn't have bought this game to have an exclusive redemption code to play online. Imagine if I didn't? I would have to buy that darn thing. Preposterous!

Pros: Fun gameplay, scary, crisp graphics, excellent audio, multiplayer online, comes w/ a FREE game (at least with my purchase, ""dead space extraction."" which by the way, was originally released on Nintendo Wii. Its about 3 gigs installs in your PS3s hard drive; its best played w/ playstation move but, sixaxis works too but its clumsy >_>, it only uses about 3 megs of internal memory space so yes, i'm happy and last but not least it is compatible w/ playstation eye.. I don't care about it but, heck at least they're putting it to use.

This game would fit in the action/adventure. You get lotz of sweet weapons like the 9MM,Heavy Machine Gun,Shotgun,and the cool Rocket Launcher and(my personal favorite) the almighty Anti Tank Rifle. Ragina also gets a preety awesome missle pod. There are way more dinosaures than you can shake a leg at. On every screen there has to be atleast 2 dinos if not 3 or 4. There are about 20 dinos on here for every single dino on dino crisis 1. There are also lots of different dinos like the swimming thingers that live in the water,the Flying thingers, Ovi Raptors,Allasaures and of course the main dinos the Raptors. Even our old buddy the T-Rex is back and there is an even LARGER dino that the T-Rex fears. Every time you kill a dino you get points called extinct points that you can use to buy tools, gunns, ammo and recovery items. The replay value is great because after you beat the game you get the extra crisis mode where you get to buy dinos and battle them with a friend and every time you beat the game you get a new dino.

5.0,False,"01 20, 2017",A1UQUDT2Q0YENM,B017W16ZUI,Michael,"I pre ordered this and am having a lot of fun with it. I like the dragon quest series and just finished dragon quest VII 3DS. I bought two copies of this so my son can have one too. I bought from Amazon and another online retailer and the other retailer arrived yesterday. So I've already got about eight hours in. I'm really enjoying it, but I like dragon quest games. I'm an adult so I appreciate a portable version of the game because I don't have as much time to sit in front of a TV anymore!

MY SHORT REVIEW:
If you like RPGs with turn based battles, this is one of the best. It modernizes a little bit, but it's still old-school in many ways. It's a full-length RPG. You get 70+ hours of gameplay and it's worth playing. If you haven't played other dragon quest games, this is one of the best. You don't need to play other ones first. And if you're not a hardcore RPG person, it's probably good to skip a lot of the other ones. I really suggest it:

MY REALLY LONG REVIEW:
This is my third version of dragon quest VIII. I played it all the way through on the PS2. I played it some on the IOS but I didn't like the cramped view nor did I like the touch controls. I plan on playing it through on the 3DS. I don't think this is the definitive version. There are pros and cons to all the versions. But I'm really liking this 3DS version so far.

GRAPHICS:
The graphics aren't exactly like the PS2 version, but I think they're as good as the 3DS can do. I think there are the same number of polygons as the PS2 version, but the edges are more jaggy. The textures are lower resolution so things are sometimes fuzzier. Compared to other 3DS games, the graphics are great. I think the graphics are a step up from Dragon Quest VII on the 3DS. The graphics are among the best graphics on the 3DS and the animation is spectacular. It's one of the few RPGs with fully animated battles. If you're expecting 3DS style graphics, they're very good. I'm willing to overlook the graphics knowing I can take it with me. And I much prefer the button controls to the IOS/Android versions.

BATTLES AND GAMEPLAY:
Seeing the enemies on the map is good, but it doesn't mean you'll be fighting less. Yes, you can avoid more of the battles, but it doesn't mean you should. My first time out of town: I spent some time fighting, went back to town to go to the inn to heal, went fighting again, went back to town before moving on a little bit. It's not a casual RPG, and I wouldn't want it to be. You can avoid battles and be picker about who you fight, but you'll still be battling a lot. It's maybe less grindy, but it's not a ""no grind"" game.

The battles are turn based. This was the first Dragon quest that showed the whole battle field and there are great turn based battles. You can speed up the battles a bit with an option in the menus. I really appreciate seeing what my characters are doing. This game has my favorite turn based battles that aren't strategy games. It's old-school in that it's menu driven battles, but it works. I'm a computer tech who often plays for ten minutes while I wait for something to happen on the computer I'm working on. So turn based really works for me!

You can up your characters stats with skill points you get from battling. The skill point system may be a little less flexible than a class system because you can never really change a character's roll. But you can customize the characters enough to make them your own. On the PS2 you applied skills without knowing what it would do. On the 3DS you can see where upping certain skills will take you. That's a huge upgrade to the gameplay on the 3DS!

OLD SCHOOL:
There are some modern improvements, but there are still some quirks that are not as common in modern RPGs. It starts really slow, and you have to do some stupid running around at the beginning of the game that just drags. It gets a lot better after that. I also think the further you are in the game, the better it is. It's a slow build up, but it builds up. Battles have some old-school oddities. Your character has to be holding items to use them in battle for instance. If you've been playing the series, you're used to the quirks. But if you're new to Dragon quest, getting by the quirks is worth it!

STORY AND CHARACTERS:
The story isn't epic, but it's really good. You get more involved in your party characters than previous Dragon Quest games. It's not a surprise twist kind of story. It's more that you enjoy the story even though you can see where it's going because you want to see what happens to the characters and what they do.

EXPLORATION:
There's lots to explore in this game. It's an epic size game. It's very linear. There isn't a ton of stuff at every spot, so you are walking from one area to the next with battles in between. There is sometimes a chest hidden around the corner. There are a few but not many side quests. There is some post game content. The towns and places you go are often very detailed. Over-worlds and towns you can explore have been going out of fashion. Even though there aren't secrets in every corner, the whole world is fleshed out.

Conclusion:
You don't see many turn based RPG games anymore unless you like strategy RPGs. This is one of the best ever and it's worth playing. It has its quirks and it's not perfect, but it's a really good game.",My favorite Dragon Quest in the Series,1484870400,7,,

I love everything about them, from the music, to the graphics, to the storylines intricately woven into each one.  Now comes Silent Hill 4 The Room, which is a new story that revolves around the events in all the other games.  Well, I shouldn't say that, but the other games have something to do with this one, in one way or another.
I have just beaten this game, and I was quite impressed.  The story was good, the graphics were good.  But wait, something is missing.  Actually, make that three things are missning.

For anyone who have ever played any of the Silent Hill games, you should have noticed certain reoccuring items in 1 through 3.
One, the fog.  Two, the radio.  Three, the flashlight.  None of which make an appearance in the new game.  Sure, it is set in the town of Ashfield, near Silent Hill, but still, that only compensated for the missing fog.  But what about the other two items?  I mean, what's a Silent Hill game without your radio freaking out and your crappy flashlight barely giving you any visibility?  I'll tell you what it is, it's a new survival horror game that is never really dark (light-wise).

In fact, it is quite possibly the brightest of all the games.  I mean sure, the other games were bright when you were outside, but still.  They also had some pitch black areas too.  Almost throughout the entire game, everything is well lit.  Which won't hurt the games score, but it's just something that i've grown to love in these games.  And as for the radio, well, the only thing that comes close is the ghosts making your screen start to mess up and then there's a bit of static, but there's no explanation for it.  Well, I guess it makes his head hurt whenever they are near, so it does make sense in that way.  But still, even then, he's still lacking that small appliance from his person.

Which is something else, you have a limited amount of items you can carry on you at one time.  You have a chest back in your room that you can drop things you don't need at the moment into, but if you accidentally pick up something you didn't really mean to pick up, you have no way of dropping it until you find a hole to get back to your room.  So sometimes you'll have to waste a full clip of pistol ammo or use a nutrition drink to clear up a slot so you can pick up the key item you need to take with you.  This is probably my only complaint, and it really isn't worth whining about.  I do like the on-screen health bar and swing meter, which thankfully fade away after you're out of combat, as does the item selection menu.  Because I would be really pissed of if I had to have some freaking crap cluttering up my screen and blocking the gorgeous graphics.

If I can I'd like to add a little here on the new main enemies, ghosts.  These apparitions come through the walls and float around chasing you.  If they get too close, without even getting their hands on you, you will recieve damage.  The coolest one is that of a main (semi-main) character, who, when in ghost form, kind of resembles the little girl from The Ring, you know, the one that crawls out of the television.  What I really found cool about this character is when you knock her down, she doesn't always get right back up, sometimes she'll use here arms to pull her around all crazy like on the floor toward you.  Pretty creepy.

I know that I don't talk much about the story or the characters in my reviews, maybe that's because I like to sprawl out the rest of the stuff in the game that nobody else talks about.  But if you want to know, you play as a man named Henry Townsend.  And at the beginning of the game, you have already been trapped in your apartment for five days.  The front door is covered in chains and locks and none of the windows open.  While in your apartment, you can listen to the radio, if anything is on other than static, look through the peephole to the hallway outside and watch people walk by or have an arguement, look through the hole in your wall in the living room to see into the room next door where a very special girl spends time watching t.v. or painting her nails.  But one day, you find a gaping hole in your bathroom wall and decide to ivestigate, upon doing so, you get a steel pipe (i'm glad they atleast left that in there, I sure do like beating things with my steel pipe), and the story begins to unfold.  And on the story, while good, it wasn't what I expected.  Sure it was twisted and insane, but it just didn't have that punch at the end.  No real shocking twist.  But oh well, if you liked or loved the other games, buy this one immediately.  But I would just like to warn you, this game is totally different from the others.  It's not so much Silent Hill 4, it's either The Room or Ashfield Heights.

All in all, a great game, just not a real Silent Hill game.  Still spooky though.  If it does one thing better than anything else, it's the sense of claustrophobia you get from spending so much time in your room, which you won't want to stay in for too long later in the game...one word: haunted.",A new Silent Hill formula to keep you awake...,1094688000,20,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

5.0,False,"03 4, 2012",AWVCQU7QKVPXD,B0050SYNYQ,Antonio Gonzalez,"I purchased the collector's edition about two months ago from another seller and I paid $75 dollars for it ,since it was on sale. I thought I really got lucky ,since it costs twice as much but I say that even at $99 (which is the current price) it's still worth it ,since you are getting one of the greatest games of this generation .The game itself it's amazing and quite unique ,from the moment you start the game you feel like you've just stepped into an incredible and beautifully crafted world and nothing seems impossible, as you venture deeper into the world you often get lost in the beauty of the game and the natural stunning surroundings ,the more you walk in the game the more it becomes addictive ,you feel the need to explore and experience every inch of the game.

The gameplay it's empowering ,it makes you feel in control of everything ,from running to drawing your weapon ,or casting a spell ,the feeling is satisfying it handles pretty good on the Xbox controller. Comparing the gameplay from Fallout 3 and Oblivion I'd say that Bethesda has really done their homework ,they've sure added tons of amazing features and much welcomed improvements to it. The leveling system it's genius , an example of that would be; whenever you hit an enemy with a short sword ,you slightly increase the ""one handed"" skill and as you increase your skill you slightly level up in the game and every time you level up you can choose to increase either your overall Magica ,Health or Stamina also you gain perks in every level (similar to Fallout 3),granting your character unique abilities. It also used to be that at the beginning of the game you had to choose between signs to become either a mague , warrior, thieve etc. But now there's the Standing Stones that are scattered throughout the world ,which they work in a similar way as the signs do ,giving your character increased or unique abilities ,the difference now is that you don't have to be stuck with your abilities it if you don't want to, you can change stones anytime and change the abilities that came with it ,that is if you don't like your current one ,therefore making the process of the character creation a more personalized experience. Though you still have to choose one of the 10 different races and each race has a unique skill,so you are still stuck if you don't like your character,unless you start a new game. The side quests are quite fun, even though some of them are more easily forgettable tan others and could've been more interesting ,though you will have tons of fun completing them ,so I'd say it's fair. The dialogues between the characters feels more natural and less of a pain to access this time ,a great improvement compared to Oblivion.
The graphics in the game are sunning for it's size, even though they're not perfect and you can see many flaws in them ,they are consistent and they look better than many other much smaller size games ,which is extremely impressive,since the game only comes in one disc!. The story is good ,but not great (I won't talk about it since it contains spoilers). I though that it was not as epic as it could've been or as remarkable like in Oblivion ,at times it feels hollow and uninteresting ,I wish they'd made it more memorable and added more twists to it. I was hoping for a story that would leave me breathless and satisfied but no ,I was little disappointed about the plot ,specially in the last boss fight ..it didn't have that impact I thought it would and the quest itself was pretty easy to beat even at the hardest difficulty ,you could tell that it had room for improvement. But I guess the amazing parts of the game overcome the flaws ,making it a whole amazing package and an awesome gaming experience,in the end I'd say that this game is closer to perfection than many other I've seen so far. It definitely deserved the spot of 2011's G.O.T.Y. and will set the example for many great games to come.
Now talking about the collector items ,I would say that they are average-high quality ,the Alduin statue it is highly detailed and well crafted ,it's made out of high quality PVC and it is reasonably heavy, it also has flexibility so it's not as fragile as many would assume,the stand-holder for the statue is made of regular lower quality plastic and it's hollow, so is light weight ,the statue and the stand go together nicely, if anything a just bit dull.
The art book it's a higher quality item than the statue if you ask me ,the cover is made out of leather and has the Skyrim logo ink pressed on it ,the concept art pictures are beautiful and quite pleasing if you are an art lover ,all in all the book it's heavy and well crafted. The thing that I wasn't too happy about from the items it's the case of the game, even though it's quite detailed and has also the Skyrim logos and decorations pressed and printed on it it's made out of thin cardboard which is disappointing ,given that it's for such a great game. It would've been nicer if they had put it in a leather case or at least a steel case ,I think that would've made it the perfect collector's edition ,but that's just my own opinion. Anyways it's not a deal breaker , with all the contents of this edition and the awesome game ,I would say that is well worth the $99 and you will not regret this purchase, so buy it and hope you enjoy it like I do.",AN INCREDIBLE GAME AND AN AWESOME COLLECTOR'S EDITION,1330819200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Welcome to F.E.A.R. 2. Before the first F.E.A.R. came out in 2005, there wasn't really any other game that featured scares, loads of blood, more bullets than a John Woo movie, and a story very reminiscent of John Carpenter. If you've read the other reviews here, then you're probably questioning whether you should buy this or not. It is true that the ending is very much on the weird side, and maybe a little (and I mean little) disappointing, but in no way does it ruin the game. Everything that made the first game good is back with a lot more to offer: great graphics, great gameplay, great plot twists, and plenty of scary moments meant to test your sanity. Plus, if you thought Alma was scary while she was locked up in a vault, how about when she's unleashed? While the game does answer questions from the first game, more have arisen, and will hopefully be answered should Monolith do another sequel. In the meanwhile, enjoy this game.

Also check out Condemned 1 & 2, two great psychological thrill rides. If you do decide to check out Condemned 2, hopefully you have an Xbox 360.

She likes all the games and technique sections that teach her how to do different things other than just strumming all 6 strings wildly  :)

The amp section is pretty fun to.....all I ever had was my little practice amp so its kinda neat to hear how different setups sound.

Its true this doesn't teach a lot of theory or the why you play this or that, but its a game and it should be fun, so I get that.

5.0,False,"11 28, 2011",AYGZPH8RLIQYS,B005FEX576,Christopher,"I was cautious of Fishing Resort, when a game is a new release and has a discounted price that is usually a red flag. But I ignored my ""spidey-sense"" and bought it (had to buy it with the rod, only one store in town had it and they only had one). I quickly discovered that I was wrong, Fishing Resort is a great game.

The beauty is in the simplicity: You're on vacation to Panagkapan Island (a tropical location that oddly has areas each with their own drastically different climate) and you're there to fish. The fish you catch earn you points (the currency on the island) and you use the points to buy new tackle and gear, as well as cloths for the character you create (you can't use you Mii, unfortunately). For those who want more substance, there are missions given by the other island-goers, daily activities to participate in (going trolling out in the ocean, catching specific fish for people, and competitions), as well as online leaderboards and new fish that are added via wi-fi (essentially, free dlc).

What I really enjoy is the cohesiveness: you wake up in your hotel room and make your way out to the beach. Don't want to walk? Purchase a bike for the day and go cycling. You never are required to accept missions or participate in extra activities (although it'll earn you more money), you can simply fish and enjoy the ambience. Too many fishing games I've tried are arcadey and break the immersion. This game embraces the quiet serenity of fishing.

As far as negatives go, the day night cycle is great but you're forced to go back to your hotel room when it gets too late (although eventually there is a way to stay out very late). The multiplayer is odd - when you're fishing you can add wii remotes and there will be another person fishing alongside you, whoever hooks first the camera zooms in on them as they reel in the fish. The fishing rod accessory works well...but I prefer playing without it. The motion controls really do work well (this game is actually motion-plus compatible, something not marked on the box) but casting my line doesn't always read.

It really is a fantastic game, and I know it will be overlooked. Obviously the publishers fealt the same way because the $20-$30 price is clearly not because of a lack of quality on the developers part.

The charging dock is great for easy charging at home.
The carrying case is handy for me, since I like to play on the go.
The USB SD card reader will be handy if I want to transfer photos to my computer. For whatever reason, everyone gets silly when getting their picture taken by the DS.
The car charger and tote bag will be great for long car rides.
The screen cleaner is clearly handy to have.
I like having the extra styluses, just in case I lose the one that came with the DS.

I have no use for the earbuds or audio splitter, since I would rather just turn off the volume if I am in public.
I don't use the screen protectors or wrist straps, since I am very careful with the DS.
I have no use for game cases, since the games are all plastic cartridges. No need to worry about scratches.

I think the game is a great landmark for gamers that like stealth killing. It reminded me very much of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, but since Ubisoft developed both games, I'm not surprised. The nice thing about the original AC is that you don't have to worry about weapon upgrades, armor, rations, or currency. This games omits the worry of grinding for better gear or prepping your character for boss kills. If you deviate from the original story that Altair lived, you will know it (no room for forgiveness, which I guess makes the gameplay somewhat linear). You have the option to collect capital flags, but they really don't DO anything except entertain you when you want to stray from the main story.

The Ear Force Recon headphones were easy to use with my computer and PS4. There's a long speaker-port/USB extension cord for PS3/PS4 use, which you don't need if you want to use it with your computer or mobile/portable devices. There is also a mini remote for volume and Mic Mute toggling. While the PS4 just requires the USB, PS3 setup requires an additional connection using an AV cable. An RCA Splitter Cable is included but you still need to use the PS3 AV Cable with this to connect.

My only problem with these headphones was that prolonged wearing does get warm and a bit sweaty. Although comfortable, the padded leather ear material does insulate. I do have this problem with most headphones though. I would also echo other reviews that these are a somewhat snug fit. My hat size is around 7-3/8 cap, and these headphones fit me well but only when close to or at full extension.","Comfortable, affordable headphones with great sound quality",1444694400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

For one, it's a good turn-based game. Turn based does differ of course from RTS games. In Turn Based you build things in a number of turns whereas in an RTS you build them in real-time. Civilization has everything. It's not just a military game. It has depth. You can build more wonders of the world than in any game I've ever seen and those wonders actually have very useful impacts. There's a technology tree that span all history that is actually accurate! The units are accurate, the unit relationships are accurate! And the combat sequences actually have a complex mathematical formula which ensures that the same thing doesn't happen every time one unit attacks another unit. All in all, it's a great game, only to be bested by the sequel, Civ IV, which I would greatly recommend to all.

5.0,False,"03 3, 2009",A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,B001QTXMRC,Senor Zoidbergo,"I thought I'd clarify the included content in the ETW: Special Forces Edition.  It would appear that Creative Assembly is working with different retailers to provide different unique units, which cannot be obtained otherwise, except through that specific retailer.  These unique units are generally more powerful than the regular ones featured in-game.

**It would appear that at this time, there is no way to buy all 9 special units.**

The Collector's Edition adds a flask (with real gin perhaps?), compass, campaign map, treasure chest, and art book.

And here's a run-down of the basic 6-units you'd get from Amazon/Steam.

  *  HMS Victory: The Royal Navy's most distinguished and formidable first rate ship of the line; Lord Nelson's 104 gun flagship is one of the most heavily armed ships of the 18th Century.

  * Rogers' Rangers: Major Robert Rogers' company of rangers are highly trained elite light infantry, specialising in reconnaissance and special operations. They are extremely mobile in even the most challenging environments.

  * Ottoman Organ Gun: A viciously powerful field gun, able to inflict incredible damage on the opposing army. Emphatic proof of the Ottoman Empire's advanced knowledge of gunpowder and firearms technology.

  * Ghoorkas:""Better to die than be a coward"" has been the motto of these elite Nepalese soldiers for centuries. Disciplined, tough and courageous, they carry a deadly 18-inch long, curved knife known as the kukri.

  * Corso Terrestre Guerillas: An independent light infantry guerrilla regiment, experienced in skirmish and stealth tactics. Surprise raids and ambushes are the guerillas' favoured tactics, a way to compensate for their limited number and light armour.

  * Bulkeley's Regiment: A French unit of Irish mercenaries with a fearsome reputation for hardiness. Exceptionally tough and resilient, they make for a highly flexible and dependable regiment.

So the question is, how do you get the other 3 special forces units, e.g. the Death's Head Hussars, USS Constitution, and Dahomey's Amazons?  It turns out that the game is already coded with for all the special forces units, and unlocking them may just require particular research or holding certain territories.

USS Constitution: this unit is only available when playing as the USA and your technology has sufficiently advanced. It may also be captured by opposing factions.

Death's Head Hussars: this unit is only available when playing as Prussia and your technology has sufficiently advanced. Prussia must also hold Brandenburg.

Dahomey Amazons: this unit is only available when holding territory in North Africa.",Clarification of Special Forces Edition,1236038400,63,,

Patapon is a rhythm based side scrolling game.  It is really difficult to draw similarities because quiet simply there is no other game like it.

This game tries to bring a few new things to the table.

I'll start with...

The Good

1 Just like the previous titles, the game play is very addictive.
2 Art style is phenomenal
3 Game play is unique and refreshing.
4 You can, for the most part, play it in 5 minute bursts when you have the time.  I pick it up and put it down all night long in between other activities.
5 You can also play it for hours on end and to be honest there are likely hundreds of hours of game play here.
6 Its true, in this version you can level up your weapons at the blacksmith.  This is important as it is hard to advance if you ignore this feature.
7 This is a big one, your patapons no longer die in battle.  I am sure Sony realized that everyone was resetting their PSPs anyway.  The prospect of having a character you spent dozen of hours developing lost forever was absolutely stupid.

Now for the bad.

1 Much like the 2nd game, there comes a point when you have to do a little level grinding in order to advance.  This could be a lack of skill on my part, but I am an avid gamer and have played the first two extensively so if it is happening to me it will certainly happen to others.

...Edit Level your weapons at the blacksmith!  I was not and it made things much more difficult.

2 This game is much deeper in terms of the extras outside of battle, for one thing thing they added multiplayer, but getting into a game is not intuitive and too be honest I found the process cumbersome.

More Good (previously undecided)
These are things I'm not sure that I like or dislike yet

1 You no longer collect materials to create your patapons at the mater tree.  You now start with 4 basic patapons and all the later ones are evolve by leveling the ones previously unlocked.  It's an interesting feature, but I find myself playing patapons I don't like as much to see what they unlock.  I'm sure that's not all bad, but it can be frustrating.

Edit...  In the in end, I liked this feature, I discovered that you can make vastly different armies with very different strategies.  In this regard, this game is much, much deeper than the first two.

2 You no longer have JUJU, now you summon a djinni its much different (easier) but changes the strategy again not necessarily bad, just different.

Edit...  This had to grow on me I definitely like it now.

Final thoughts

This is an absolutely stunning game.

5.0,True,"08 17, 2015",A2P71DSKT85VEH,B00E4MQODC,Robert Hoadley,"This is my 6th Logitech mouse and my second gaming mouse from the same company.  I'm a current owner of a G700 which I purchased a couple of years ago.  While I like the G700, I almost always use it as a ""wired"" mouse because  the battery life is just too short to last through a long gaming session. When PC Gamer made the Logitech G602 their top gaming mouse, I knew I had to give this a try and I'm very happy with that decision. While this mouse has some nice features, in my opinion it's best feature bar none is the silky smooth ride.  Compared to my G700, and really any mouse wired or wireless that I've ever used this mouse is super smooth.  I have no way of  knowing if it will stay that way over the long haul, but the difference is shocking and felt a little like the difference between driving a small pickup truck verses a Volvo S80, it is that pronounced.  The mouse also features a wonderful thumb rest, six side mounted programmable buttons and two top mounted buttons that default to adjusting the dpi but can also be programmed to any value you want using Logitech's ""Gaming Software"" utility which can be down loaded from their site.  The comes with a small wireless receiver which stores in the battery compartment when not in use, a standard set of AA batteries(two) and a USB extension cable to improve wireless reception if needed and a small users guide.  The batteries actually double as a poor man's weight adjustment device as the mouse will operate with a single battery installed in either the left or right compartment.  In my case with a ride so smooth, I opted for the slightly heavier feel and longer operation life afforded by both batteries.  The mouse also has a small button just behind the scroll wheel that is used to help conserve battery life, by lowering the transmission rate when you aren't gaming. While I love the overall feel of this mouse, I think Logitech missed the boat by using an all rubber scroll wheel(instead of the composite rubber and metallic combination found on the G700 and M705 mice) with no programmable side scroll buttons and the absence of scroll speed adjustment switch found on some of their other high end mice.  These features were likely left off as a concession to cost, but I would have gladly have paid the extra money to have them included and hope they will include these features in a later version of this mouse.  I really miss the programmable side scroll buttons and over the short term still prefer the more expensive G700.  One other sort of nit-pick that I have with the side mounded switches is that they take a little getting used to because of the size difference between the G700 and the small buttons found on the G602.  If you have not used the Logitech Gaming software you have missed one of the companys strongest features. First this software package integrates all of their products into one interface.  Once you program one game in the interface, you can drag and drop your programmed macros and key commands to any of their gaming products.  For example, I did some testing to see which mouse I liked better in Dragon Age Inquisition and was able to drag and drop  from one device to another as shown in the pictures below:",A Great Ride at a Good Price,1439769600,19,,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61P6ouOFf6L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31TzRGOMqIL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21dx6h0+pUL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21uszZMf5-L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31I0Ury0iXL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/213OIpBSZ4L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61rl7tmY3kL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61UnMf7hj6L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/612fu2P1elL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61b+o1fbpuL._SY88.jpg']"

Yet amidst this chaotic rush to get the gargantuan Xbox one game makes the hype seem like it was worth it, like maybe Microsoft could do justice to video games, and that maybe just maybe,,, we would buy the Xbox for a reason. Halo is that game and it has affected me in an amazing way.
  Halo has been in development for years, and it shows. Never before have I played a game that is just so damn polished (well, maybe Maximo) and I like it. The feature of just two weapons at a time sounds limiting, but it is fun in some weird way. Anyone who has watched a movie about a futuristic army from Earth fighting an alien menace will fall back into Halo's world. You feel like you're a soldier there, mainly because of the graphics and more importantly the AI. I love most FPSs but Halo just put them away. The AI responds to you and even the lowliest of enemies display strategy to get you and you find yourself enjoying every kill you get. The use of terrain and companions makes the game realistic in a sci-fi setting. The two elements blend perfectly to make one hell of a fun game.

Once Sega established themselves as a worthy contender of the 16-bit era with the original Sonic The Hedgehog, they knew their newly successful mascot shouldn't be relegated to a ""one-game-wonder"" status, so they set out to follow it up with a sequel in order to keep the public's attention on them. Although Sonic was the true origin of the 16-bit wars between the giants Sega and Nintendo, this time Sega had a much greater challenge ahead of them. By 1992, the big N had just released their new SNES system along with a slew of outstanding games. Therefore Sega had to react fast. Sonic fast. They had to figure out how to draw people back to the ring collecting, speed shoes, chaos emeralds, and blue hedgehogs in a time when people were absorbed with Yoshis, Simon Belmonts, F-Zeros, and Street Fighters. Sega started work first on what would later become Sonic CD (for the Sega CD), but put it away briefly and made some other graphical upgrades to have a game ready for 1992. What resulted is Sonic 2. Did it live up to the original, or did the game fall under the inferior sequel curse? I'm sure you already know my answer...

This my friends, is a true classic. Sonic 2 not only puts to rest any worries one would've had with a Sonic sequel, but it improved greatly upon the original game as well! I'd have to say that this is probably the single best and most well-designed Sonic game ever made (although Sonic CD is still my personal favorite, and hooking Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles together truly makes the best sonic game). Sonic 1 had awesome level structures, cool music, and fun gameplay, but its sequel takes those aspects to the next level of greatness. In addition to what's already established, this game adds great things like the Speed Dash, Tails/Miles the fox, chemical plants, 2 player competition modes, the 7th chaos emerald, the Death Egg ship, corkscrew tunnels, oil oceans, speedy bonus stages, coconut throwing monkeys, the starpost, and Super Sonic. Take a look at all the stuff that makes this game great and the (very) few small quibbles that it falls short:

PROS
-EXCELLENT LEVEL DESIGNS. Sonic's main gimmick was that he's fast, right? Well Sega wisely chose to center the level structures this time around his speedy characteristics and as a result, the levels are extremely fun to go through. There's still plenty of platforming action amidst the flurry of speed, so the challenge is ever present. The Zones are extremely varied as well, so you'll never get bored with the levels.
-ENTER TAILS THE FOX. Joining Sonic's (then) latest adventure is this small orange fox who sports 2 tails allowing him to fly. In single player mode, he accompanies you in collecting rings and rescuing you from the clutches of robots. Another person can control him as well.
-AWESOME 2 PLAYER MODE! This mode is really fun because it pits two people against each other going through one of 4 zones from the game. There's some cool powerups that make things extra difficult for the other player.
-THE MUSIC SOUNDTRACK HERE IS SOME OF THE BEST IN VIDEOGAME MUSIC. Seriously. This ranks up there with Mega Man 2, Gradius 2 & 3, Castlevania 4 & SotN, and Turrican as far as jaw-dropping video game music goes. Not a single one of these tunes is bad, and all are very catchy, probably some of the best that you'll find on the Genesis. My favorites have to be the Chemical Plant, Aquatic Ruin, (2-player) Mystic Cave, and Metropolis tunes.
-MUCH BETTER SPECIAL STAGES. This time around, you're put in a 3D-ish tunnel in which you have to collect a certain amount of rings and avoid the spike traps. It's still very challenging like the first game's stages are, but thankfully it eliminates the frustration by offering you A LOT MORE chances to tackle them throughout the game.
-EVEN BETTER ASSORTMENT OF ENEMIES THIS TIME. There are a lot of cool enemies you'll face like the aformentioned monkeys with coconuts, armored crabs, lava dragons, claw mantis, and the extendable catepillar.
-Before I forget, THE SPEED DASH IS A MUCH WELCOME ADDITION! This aids in the speedy level design because now you have a new way to  take off turbo-charged from a standstill.
-SUPER SONIC!! Okay, so even if this idea is somewhat ripped off from the Super Saiyan of Dragon Ball Z, it's still awesome to be able to transform into this fiery yellow, superfast, invincible flying blur once you've obtained all the chaos emeralds.

CONS
-Despite being able to control Tails in the single player mode, it's not nearly as much fun for the second player because they can't really help out much. What's worse is that you can't make Tails fly and lift Sonic to higher places yet (wait til Sonic 3).
-While the zones are a lot of fun to play through and there are a lot of them, it comes with the price of there being only 2 acts to complete per zone instead of 3 (except for Metropolis Zone). Some stages later on are only a single act long.
-SOME OF THE BOSSES ARE FAR TOO EASY. It's true. Unlike the first game's bosses in which some were fairly easy, many of Dr. Robotnik's latest contraptions can be taken out in a pathetic matter of seconds.

That's all the minor complaints I can think of. Everything else about this game rules. It goes without saying that Sonic 2 is a surefire classic, and most every Sonic fan already owns this one. It makes as a great introduction for new fans, and it never gets old, even though it technically is an old-school game.

Sure, there are fun titles out now with gorgeous graphics (Fight Night), but the gameplay cannot be beat here. The controls are simple: you move side to side with the left and right buttons on the directional pad, duck with the down button, and A and B are for right and left jabs respectively (hold up with these to perform uppercuts).

The game consists of you, Little Mac, as you make your way through 3 divisions until you finally earn the right to face Tyson himself. The fighters in this game range from rediculously easy to very difficult to beat. But it is all about patterns. Once you learn the fighter's techniques, get your reflexes down, and beat them you are that much closer to fighting Mike Tyson. This is where it is almost rediculously hard, as he is no joke! It takes serious practice and concentration before you will be able to defeat him. Even Mr. Sandman and Macho Man before him are difficult for a while.

I keep my items in pristine condition as money doesn't grow on trees so stuff better not break. I own an Elite model and the Halo 3 Special Edition 360's and both are really loud and seem to be on their deathbeds. I have been waiting and waiting for the right updated system to take their place. The XBox 360 S came out though still the black glossy look just screamed fingerprints, but sure enough the wait is finally over.

The Halo Reach Console Bundle was my dream come true and sure enough it has held up to my high expectations for a remodel as it is lighter, slimmer, and most importantly quiet.

It does have a ""special"" sound when the disk tray opens and closes though it is really not that noticeable and almost not even worth mentioning. The two controllers are perfect and the d-pad on these actually work pretty well though the bad thing is that it doesn't come with rechargeable batteries so be prepared for that.

Another problem is that this does not come with the Hard Drive transfer cable if you want to take your information from your older system to this one though everything else about this system is great and is a must for any new owners or ones that need to upgrade to the newer model as the money is worth it.

One lethal move is when you approach an enemy from the front, Fisher pulls out his knife and grabs the guy head and forces it down while stabbing him below the shoulder blade all by pulling the right trigger. Or if you pull the left trigger and your behind someone then Fisher will pull out his knife and hit them with the handle in the side of the head and knock them out. There are countless other things fisher can do to take out his enemies. The enemy AI is amazingly done, they will notice little things like a door open or a light turned off.

I played the game on the difficulty below elite, and it was definitely a challenge. The game sets you up for some truly epic battles. It isn't a corridor shooter but a true war simulator. Every level includes an epic battle of some sort. The AI in this game is pretty ridiculous, once you play this game you'll laugh at how stupid AI is in other games. Obviously the graphics are unmatched. Destroys crysis.

The online is what really makes this game in my opinion. You expect an fps in this generation to have an online component and Killzone's online destroys Call of Duty 4 & 5. The game awards you medals for completeting class based objectives. These medals basically level up that particular class. For example I have been playing as a medic. In order to unlock the medic class you have to put about 2 or 3 hours into the online, in which time you also unlock the shotgun and helghast smg. Once you have the medic class you gain the ability to revive. Revive 5 players per match and you get a medal. Get 8 medals and you level up your medic and unlock the ability to throw med packs. There are also a lot more classes, like the scout, engineer, tactician, and assault. The online makes leveling up each class fun.

The game is simple enough - we are the unseen God of a little tribe of people who look like walking eyeballs called the Patapon. We start out with a small group of soldiers called Yaripon, and embark on a quest to defeat the evil Zigoton tribe, and find the elusive ""IT"".

The soldier classes are the following:

Yaripon - Spear throwing soldiers
Tatepon - Foot soldiers
Yumipon - Archers
Kibapon - Soldiers on horseback
Dekapon - Ogres
Megapon - Soldiers with musical horns

Now like any good Role Playing Game (RPG), you have to decide which soldiers are the best suited for each mission. Some are good at hunting, others are not. Some rush headlong into battle, others wait it out and release devastating attacks from afar.

Here's the gameplay twist - for your platoon to perform any action, you have to tap out special drum beats on the PSP buttons.

For example:

Moving your platoon requires the beat ""pata-pata-pata-pon""
Ordering your platoon to attack requires the beat ""pon-pon-pata-pon""

If drum beats are played successfully a number of times in a row, you can unlock ""fever mode"" - this unlocks more powerful attacks and quicker troop movements. If you miss a beat, you have to start again. As you get more proficient at Patapon, you can unlock more advanced drum beats, create more powerful soldiers, unlock mini-games, find hidden artifacts, discover miracles, and more.

During each mission you can gather currency (known as ka-ching!), various raw materials, and weaponry. These items can be used to create more powerful Patapon soldiers during the level breaks.

There are a few negative items about Patapon:

(1) There is no pause button. Once you start a stage, it can take up to 7 minutes to clear. Any interruptions and it's bye, bye, fever mode.
(2) There is an item pickup error. Sometimes when Patapon finish their victory song, they will walk right over some items without adding them to the spoils of war.

Patapon is a fun and very addictive little game. With over 30 levels and 4 mini-games, that's a lot of playability for a great price. This is the only PSP game I've come across that combines problem solving, strategizing, and bongo-beating into a hilarious little package.

If you like rhythm games such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-Dance-Revolution/dp/B0002IQOOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance Dance Revolution</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PaRappa-The-Rapper/dp/B000R3K4CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PaRappa The Rapper</a>, you will definitely find a lot of enjoyment playing Patapon.

If rhythm games aren't your thing, or if the aforementioned issues would cause you frustration, you might want to skip this one.

Don't worry, the best way to know if you're addicted to Patapon is if someone in your house comes down with a temperature and the first thought in your head is:

5.0,True,"07 7, 2017",A3LX4A2WF7NUO5,B00KSVXSZU,Zamizi,"I bought this headset because several people I know recommended turtle beach headsets. I was looking for a set that had a flexible mic boom and was light weight and within a 50$ budget. I bought the refurbished version and a 4 year warranty that brought the total to just over but I feel it was worth it to have the warranty.

the sound on this headset is wonderful! no tinny or hollow effects and I can hear everything in my games and movies. I like that the mic is metal wrapped and removable so you can use them as just an awesome set of headphones. amplified means there is no in-line volume or mic control, so you need some other way to control volume and mic muting. it comes with an adapter that controls all the functions this headset is capable of, but if you have a chat pad like I do, the set works well enough with those controls as well, you just have no controls over the bass boost or mic monitoring, but the sound from the chat pad is very good and has plenty of bass.

I don't know yet about the endurance of the product itself. I treat my electronics well and the set seems sturdy enough. they are light weight compared to other headsets, but they really aren't all that light. they are very comfortable and fit over my ears nicely. I have a small head, and the cups are neither too tight nor too loose. I like the textured fabric on the cups that allow a certain amount of breathability that can be essential.

my only criticism is that the cord is very short, it only needs to be while plugged into an Xbox controller. but if you want to be more than 3 feet from whatever its plugged into you need an extension cord. but over all, I would recommend this headset.",I bought this headset because several people I know recommended turtle beach headsets,1499385600,7,{'Style:': ' Certified Refurbished'},

No, Red Dead Redemption is no mere ""Grand Theft Horse"". You'll be intrigued and overjoyed with the open world, just riding around on a fast steed while the sun slowly sets around you is a fantastic experience. But there's more to it than that - challenges, outfits, minigames (play a hand of poker or throw some horseshoes), stranger missions, rare weapons, breakable horses, unique environmental encounters, and of course a sandbox multiplayer mode where you can join a posse of eight players to rid the gang hideouts from villany, or just go out hunting for animals and pick flowers if you choose to. There's also the regular Free For All Deathmatches, Capture The Flag (in this case Bag), and unique downloadable co-op missions. However, all this might overshadow what lies at the core of the game - an extremely well-produced, gripping, funny and touching storyline with the flair of old westerns and the heart of a good adventure. This is no mere gangster story, but about a man seeking to leave his old ways behind and start over - but in order to do that, he'll have to reunite with his family, whether shedding blood on the way or not. To accompany him on his journey is a beautiful soundtrack, with a mixture of Morricone-style instrumentals and artist contributions.

Of course, no game is perfect though. There have been some server issues (players being ""incompatible"" and a ""double microphone"" effect which is easily fixed), and ""griefing"" is an annoying problem (online players can shoot anyone they like, thus running around like five year olds with toy guns). It can be tough to shoot people while you're indoors, trains block the path into certain towns, and some random encounters (which I call ""hung wife-encouters"") are nearly impossible to complete. These are just minor annoyances though, and they don't really take away from the overall enjoyment of a tremendously well-produced game, on a single disc so packed with experiences and events that you won't want to leave the world for months.

I have an HD TV and I am viewing them on there and I love the graphics. I have been one who has played the EA versions of football, both NCAA and Madden. I love EA football, BUT, after playing this, I must commend 2k for making a relistic football game. I have not played Madden 08 yet, but from what I have played, since 2000 with Madden, was really no change in graphics or gameplay. Players walking through each other, getting called for stupid penalties, players making unrelistic moves. I loved NCAA football this year, BUT I missed the classic teams, AND also, it is pretty cheezy to leave refs out of the game. If you want realistic gameplay, leaving out refs is not the way to go there.

I felt the realism in 2K was amazing. I did not get the chance to play 2k5, and I know so many felt that was the better football game. And it is probably why EA was granted the NFL license because the NFL could not handle anyone else being better than those they were contracted with. Do I care that there are different non NFL teams???? No. Actually, the NFL is starting to suck big time and I have turned my back so much in wanting to support it. I would love to have a game that has a whole new league. I think 2K should make a USFL game. THAT would be so awesome. There are some USFL fans out there, and it would be a big hit.

I think too many people out there are just spoiled by the greedy NFL and cant appreciate anything less than that. If you cant appreciate the gameplay and the graphics of this game, then you cant appreciate the quality of any game. If this game is so much like NFL 2K5, and people felt that was the best game ever, why cry over how this game is similar to it?? Wouldnt you WANT the game to be similar to what they had before?? If it were different, then THAT would be a disppointment right?? I commend them on keeping the features in the games that people obviously enjoyed. Granted, it would be cool if they made some changes, like adding a franchise mode, giving you more teams to choose from, more legend players, and giving you more options to create uniforms and stadiums.

Give 2k credit. People complaining left and right, is not going to make these people come out with another game and improve anything. It will just make them give you whiners the big finger, and you will all lose out and end up with the same repetitve EA games that have not changed since they were created. I say, be thankful with this game, and appreciate it for what it is. A fantastically fun game, that does not consist of the NFL greed that has plagued sports so greatly today.

I say Kudos to 2K sports for coming out with a NON NFL game. Gives those who are tired of the NFL greed something to enjoy for once without seeing the ruined league gain more money to fix more games for classless cheating teams and players. I enjoyed this game. It was mega fun, and very much worth the money. I would rather put money in the pockets of retired NFL veterans, than the current overpaid cry babies who have no clue what the game is about, and what it means.",I thought it was awesome!!,1198713600,8,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

The game is an interactive sequel to Nick Park's award-winning short film, 'Wallace and Gromit in The Wrong Trousers.' In this game, you take on the role of Gromit, Wallace's faithful sidekick, in an attempt to foil the evil Feathers McGraw's plan to take over the zoo and make diamonds. As Gromit, you'll move from one challenging level to the next, rescuing baby animals that Feathers has imprisioned and collecting tools and other items to build a bunch of wacky devices needed to advance in the game. And the game includes a bunch of extra features, including a clip on how the game was made, clips from 'The Wrong Trousers,' and 'The Snoozeatron,' the latest installment in the Cracking Contraption series.

The game's graphics are really a thing to see. While they don't look very realistic, they look almost exactly like they do in the original claymation. I think that any Wallace and Gromit fan should add this game to their collection of Wallace and Gromit merchandise.",Great game!,1125273600,11,,

5.0,False,"02 4, 2010",A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7,B000FRS9II,Siklootd,"Last year when I decided to purchase an Xbox 360 despite already owning a PlayStation 3, it was because of a select few games that remained exclusive to the Microsoft console.  Games such as Left 4 Dead, Halo, Crackdown and Mass Effect were incentives to purchase the console, but what finally made me get one was the anticipation of playing Gears of War.  Being new to the series, I figured I should start with the first game of the franchise, so last year I purchased an Xbox 360 and Gears of War on the same day.  This is a decision I wish I had made years ago.

The game starts off by placing the player in the shoes of Marcus Fenix, a member of a team known as ""Gears"", located on the planet Sera.  Marcus commands a squadron known as Delta Squad, which includes characters such as Dominic ""Dom"" Santiago, Augustus ""Cole Train"" Cole, and Damon Baird.  Their squadron is a member of the last remaining human government left on the planet, known as Coalition of Order Governments (COG).  The responsibility of COG is to fight for humanity against the alien onslaught being driven by a race known as Locusts.  Locusts are giant crocodile/human hybrid looking creatures who are capable of using heavy artillery against their enemies, in this case humans.  Marcus is handed the responsibility of placing a resonator within the tunnels where the Locust reside, this will cause an outright extermination of the race, however the team did not properly diagnose the exact size and mapping of the tunnel the first time around, so players spent the rest of the game fighting their way through the Locusts until once again getting a chance to place a resonator within their underground tunnels.

The game features unique weapons and gameplay mechanics that make the game addictive beyond belief.  Add in the ability to play the campaign mode cooperatively with other players or competitively against other players, and you have a winning formula for non-stop action.  Health bars are absent, instead replace the system with status indicators which tell the player their current state of danger.  This is done with the use of a flashing red screen that symbolizes impending doom unless the player takes cover long enough that the screen returns to normal.  The ability to chainsaw opponents in half comes in handy, especially in instances where the player is bombarded by enemies such as Wretches.  Enemies vary greatly from one another, and gameplay moments such as avoiding darkness to survive the attack of Krill is very unique.

Gears of War is visually stunning, and has mastered innovation on so many levels.  The ""cover mechanism"" was relatively new to video games before Gears of War launched, and now it is common gameplay for third person shooters and is used in games such as Mass Effect and Uncharted.  The character design is unique, the gameplay is solid, and the campaign and multiplayer modes are addicting.  This makes for a great addition to any Xbox 360 collection, and Gears of War has quickly won its place on my list of favorite franchises ever created.",Innovation Mastered,1265241600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The first featured silly characters, a shallow, easy to understand storyline, and no real weaponry beyond Jak's fist, and daxter.
The second, and newly named ""Jak 2"" has a much more dark and adult oriented premise. The game starts in the cheer village fo the first Jak and Daxter, then you find yourself hurdled into a time portal, where Jak is captured and tortured mercilessly by the ""Crimson guards,"" which are the law enforcment of the town, that is really just out to kill everyone.
once you have broken out from the prison, you discover that dark eco has been pumped directly into your system, and you now have a sort of alter ego. Once you fill up your eco gage, you can go crazy and take out multiple foes, and look really cool too!
Another addition to the sequel is vechiles. Everything hovers and flys from bikes to sedans. While travelling through the vast world, it gives a very dark dreary sense, and makes you feel out of place, thus the dark atmosphere.
The most obvious addition to this game is the weaponry. You can obtain a plethora of destructive goodys throughout the game, and use them whenever you please, yes even to shoot civilians if your sick mind is so inclined!
in conclusion, this game takes awhile to go from good to a master piece. It took me about two hours to get to the second weapon upgrade, and then i was hooked. If your expecting another cheery fun for all ages jak, look elsewhere, because this is definately not it, i mean even jak looks older and meaner! This game now leans more toward a GTA game in that you can free roam the city at anytime and pick up missions all over town, and a ratchet and clank game in the fringer smashing, mind numbing, gigantic gun battles.

It is precise, light, ergonomic and with all the bells and whistles that will make this pointing device your best acquisition for general use, office work and gaming. I have used plenty of pointing devices throughout the years and I must say I always stayed on the budget mouse market (below ~$30). I thought spending $50 on a mouse was ridiculous, but how wrong I was. This thing looks sleek and performs like clockwork. I spent a couple of days looking at the current mouse market and the options are endless. I initially planned on purchasing a $30-ish replacement for my now dying Logitech M305 (very portable and affordable IMO), but I wanted to get a larger mouse that could be used for long periods of time without busting your carpal tunnel. Well, the Rival 310 has the perfect size for me, it is light as a feather and has eSports level of accuracy, which might sound overkill for many non-professional gamers and non-gamers alike. But using this mouse JUST on the Windows desktop already feels you are dealing with something different. The movement is fluid and precise, the two main buttons always respond great (a little bit on the noisy side though), the scrolling wheel is super smooth and the side buttons are large enough to use them with no problem.

I am including a picture comparing the size of the Rival 310 with two other mice that I have at home (left to right): Logitech M305 (old faithful), Logitech M705 and the Rival 310. Did I also mention it has 6 customizable buttons (left click, right click, scroll wheel, middle button, two on the left side) and RGB lights? The SteelSeries Engine 3.0 software provides enough options to tune the mouse to your needs to the point that it is a little bit overwhelming. But once you get all those details ironed out, you are left with a great mouse that looks cool, performs great and will keep any other pointing device in the drawer for years to come.","A well-rounded, jack-of-all-trades mouse",1534636800,,"{'Color:': ' Black', 'Style:': ' Rival 310'}","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81lZ4lLMMkL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fnFYhx5nL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YMkU2LnbL._SY88.jpg']"

Everything is quite colorful and vivid, and you get a wonderful look at everything around you after someone has pushed you into a gaurdrail, causing you to flip around in the air while all the broken glass and flecks of paint and car part flaot around in slow motion along with you.  But what makes crashing really fun, besides the awesome damage animation, is the fact that when somebody makes you wreck or you hit something and crash, you can hold a button to slow everything down, and you can actually move your crashed vehicle around to put it in the path of oncoming racers that may or may not have caused you to wreck, proceeding to cause of festival of twisted metal vengeance.

But one thing that was more noticable than anything is the artificial intelligence in the other drivers.  For the first time in any racing game I actually felt bullied around, like I do when I'm playing with real people.  Which is needless to say really freakin' cool.  They ram you into oncoming traffic, tailgate, sideswipe, team up on you to sandwich your car, and coolest of all, they actually make realistic mistakes.  They will literally misjudge a drift around a corner or get faked out by you or another car and crash.  And that just blew me away.

Now, onto the thing everybody likes to talk about, the speed.  Even when not using your burnout meter, your screen is still blurred around the edges as you are pushing a minimum top speed of 150-160.  Without your boost.  That's insane!  Then, when you actually get some boost (which you can now use even when your meter isn't full) you hit speeds closer to 200 mph!  And you really take your life in your hands then, because by the time you actually see that car up ahead coming right at you in the oncoming lane, you've already smashed into it with tremdous speed.  Note: this is not a complaint, it's just a really cool idea pulled off superbly.  Sure, you can race the entire level going mach speeds if you like, but you'll probably crash more that anybody else too.  So, unless you have Elven vision, I'd just wait till you find a good clean patch of road with little to no traffic on it to really hit the gas.  Or if you're a second behind somebody, and hitting them at turbo speed would mean a pretty crash for them, then by all means use it.  You don't have to listen to me, just race and win your own way.

I'll wrap up by saying that I have not beat this game yet.  I've put about 9 hours into it so far and still haven't unlocked a third of the games unlockables.  And I haven't even touched the multiplayer yet!  So my advice to you is this:  If you want the best arcade racer ever created, buy this game.  If you're not a racing fan, or if you don't have a PS2 or XBOX, then don't bother with this game.  But if you're capable of playing this game, be prepared to let that itch on your face go until the race is over...

5.0,False,"08 13, 2009",A3OND36Q71G76D,B000ZK7ZOY,W. Scott Heitman,"The critical reception to Bionic Commando was anything but kind.  The PS3 version of the game is sitting on GameRankings with an aggregate score of 72%.  I've seen games get the short shrift before, but never so much as Bionic Commando.  I have a small confession to make;  I'm only halfway through the game, but I'm so enamored with it that I couldn't wait to write a review.  Here's the breakdown:

Graphics: Stunning throughout.  Animations seem realistic (considering the subject matter at least) and environments are breathtaking.  Not much to say because there's nothing to complain about.

Story:  I've heard that this aspect takes some criticism; apparently the ending is love it or hate it.  I'm enjoying the story partly because of the effective voice-acting.  Steve Blum always puts on a good performance, and he's effective here as Super-Joe.  I'm not familiar with the VA for the main character, but he certainly does a good job of making me believe he's enjoying the swinging as much as I am- which brings us to...

Gameplay:  There's nothing else on the market like BC.  It's not an FPS or even a standard 3rd person shooter.  The main focus is on effective use of the bionic arm.  The result has been compared to the Spider-man games, but such a comparison leaves out the nuances that BC brings to the table.  First of all, the level design is superb.  Whereas the Spider-man levels games are typically limited to swinging around the same old skyscrapers, BC's levels are filled with all kinds of broken buildings, suspended railways, caverns, and more.  Even if the mechanics of the swinging were identical, the game would play much differently.  But the swinging requires more precision than SM.  Some players make the mistake of giving the game five minutes and deciding it sucks.  It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using the arm, but once you've got it, you're in for some gameplay gold.  The reason the game ""works"", in my opinion, is that it doesn't focus on split-second reactions and near-impossible jumps.  Instead, the emphasis is on tactics.  How does one effectively navigate the war-torn landscape and attack ones' foes while evading their gun-fire?  Answering this question is the job of the player.  Using the arm, for instance, to swing into battle and then swing out to recover is a rewarding experience.  The boss battles, in particular, do a fantastic job of highlighting the difference between this game and your vanilla third person game.

Sound:  WOW!  If you're familiar with the themes from past BC games, you'll recognize some remixed themes.  This soundtrack, however, is simply outstanding.  From the elegant piano theme in the main menu to the thundering symphonic arrangements during battle, these pieces do much to elevate the gameplay to something truly special.  On a related note, I intend to do some serious searching for the sheet music to the menu music; I would love to play that on the piano.

Let's talk downsides for two seconds.  I've heard a lot of criticisms, and these are the two that I deem to be accurate:
1) Radioactive out-of-bounds.  Linear games have the difficult task of creating some means to provide limits to the environments.  The standard but laughable solution of times past has been the familiar ""invisible wall"".  BC tries something new by simply killing the player if they stray out-of-bounds for too long.  It is explained that much of the city is irradiated and that our protagonist must avoid this stuff like the plague.  Most of the time, this radiation is clear enough to see.  But those few times it surprises you can get pretty annoying.  This solution to an old problem might even be elegant if well-implemented, but there are some weird choices here.  Sometimes, the UPPER HALF of a building will be irradiated.  Usually, level limits are lateral in natural, so coming across this can be vexing.
2) Collectables.  See, you're gonna die a lot; this isn't an easy game (on Normal, at least).  Most games don't make you re-collect collectables if you die before reaching the next checkpoint.  Well, BC does.  Get used to it.

These cons are really quite minor in comparison to the fantastic gameplay on offer.  Every major aspect of BC screams high production values, and the gameplay offers something truly novel and rewarding.  The price of BC has plummeted in most places.  I found it new for 20 dollars.

People are complaining about the length of the game, but I think it's the same length as super mario land. I will probably play through it around 4 more times as I did the same with mario land.

People complain that they want something 'different' from a game and while this isn't exactly it, this game takes a different course in bringing an immersive world to this medium.

As you may already know, you play the part of 4 different characters whose lives are somehow affected by the Origami killer.

This game feels like parts of Shenmue, Minority Report, Crash and 7even.
The setting of the story is heavy and depressing. The music and overall tone does the title justice. This of course makes it for a good murder mystery. There are themes of drug abuse, depression, and overall life choices that really tell the story.

What is so engrossing the game boils down to the subtle clues and decisions that you make throughout the game and while on the outset this game seems like a QTE button masher, it's really not. Sometimes certain outcomes and scenes are played out based on buttons you may NOT push. Certain things you may or may not hear are based on conversation lines that you do or do not choose.

If anyone is old enough to remember the old Dungeouns and Dragons ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books would really feel good in having a game where at any moment the story can change for your choices. This also gives this game a lot of replayability where you can go back and play scenes and change up what you did to see if you get a different result and from what i was told, this game has many endings.

Graphically speaking, there was a lot of detail put into this game. So much so that sometimes you may forget that you are playing a game and watching a show. The settings, be it a store, seedy apartment, or a crime scene  are done very well which is why I will add, when playing this game, look at everything. Pay attention to the details, questions can sometimes pop up later based on what you heard or saw earlier. The facial features are among some of the best I have seen in a long time. You can feel the emotions through all the expressions that they give through their performances.

I will have to admit, there was once scene in which something happened to one character that because I could relate being in a similar situation, I was a bit teary eyed.

There is very little to complain about for this game. So far the 3 that stand out the most would be for one, the control set up is a bit more complex for some things than it needs to be. Walking for instance is a 2 button affair. If a sequel for this comes out, I would hope that it's streamlined to just the thumbstick. The other very minor issue is, and this may be due to hardware limitations, as graphically good as this game is, there are times where the character animations look a little too 'stiff' especially climbing stairs. Occasionally, it takes you out of the immersion that you may feel but not by much. Lastly, the voice acting is good in some places and bad in others also a minor issue but it's excusable by the fact that it's not like they hired tons of A list talent to voice this game.

One last big plus is that there is a decent amount of DLC that's coming that adds to the story of this game, so keep your eyes open.

Otherwise this game is a must have for those that want a break from MW2, Bioshock and everything else that has popped around. I would hope to see more games like this come out and use different genres like sci fi or fantasy to tell great stories. This is a game that requires some patience and good observation to get into and once you think you got it, you will want to play it again to see how it plays if you did things differently.","A ""Choose Your Adevnture"" book come to life",1267056000,2,,

5.0,True,"09 20, 2010",A2PHO6FR3GR7ZW,B001E8VB3C,Jeff White,"When you first fire up Batman: Arkham Asylum, you're going to be impressed... and if you're a Batman fan, doubly so. The visuals are stunning, and the game really marks the first time players will feel like they are the Dark Knight Detective, from whichever medium. Indeed, Arkham Asylum draws the best stuff from the comics, the movies AND the animated series for a Batman experience that will satisfy fandom across the spectrum. And for being wrapped up in such a Technicolor Dreamcoat of licensing, a lot of extra time went into Arkham Asylum that normally would not be the case, especially when partially tied to a movie franchise. Nevertheless, even with the extra time and effort afforded, the game falls short of a perfect package.

Even if you haven't played the game, you're probably already familiar with the general premise considering all the trailers, demos and general hoopla that surrounded it long before its launch. The Joker had briefly escaped the asylum, and Batman brings him back into custody only to find that is exactly what the Joker had in mind to spring his trap into motion. Now the whole island is on lockdown, but unfortunately for the hospital staff, a handful of cops, Commissioner Gordon and Batman, the lockdown doesn't include the inmates' cells. The Joker and Harley Quinn are now running the show, and, well... madness ensues. The mere fact that it takes place within the island compound of Arkham Asylum sets the entire game up for a who's who of the Batman rogues gallery. Whoever you don't actually run into, you will experience in plenty of other ways, many of which are fairly creative (Clayface immediately comes to mind). Some of these encounters will thrill you to the core. I remember my girlfriend was watching me play and she actually got frightened by the first time Killer Croc lumbers onto the scene.

There are many such creepy moments in Arkham Asylum, ranging from the slightly disturbing to the downright terrifying. Whether it's the flickering flourescent lamps in the dilapidated corridors of the infirmary, or the soft glow of moonlight smothering the Gotham City skyline from afar, you'll always feel the darkness and asylum walls closing in on you. It's sort of the first time I've felt virtual claustrophobia (is that even possible?)

But where Arkham Asylum really shines is in the gameplay. The hand-to-hand combat engine is quite simply the coolest I've ever seen. It's fast, fluid, easy to learn, hard to master, and loads of fun. You feel and look like Christian Bale in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Begins-Blu-ray/dp/B000PC6A3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Begins [Blu-ray</a>] when he seamlessly takes out a dozen of Boss Falcone's men at the docks. Batman is not a novice or some street fighter-in-training in search of experience points. In this game, Batman will kick your crazy butt. In fact, unless you're as strong as Bane and Killer Croc, or protected by poison spitting plants, you're most likely going to go down with a mininum of fuss once the Bat's gloved fist penetrates your face. I personally loved this about the game, because let's be practical, very few supervillians let alone minions could ever hope to beat the Dark Knight fist acuffs. That's WHY he's the Dark Knight and WHY he's lived long enough to have twenty plus supervillians hate his armored guts. This point couldn't be emphasized any better than when you face Harley Quinn: she's neutralized with a single takedown!

The other great part of the gameplay is how you are able to utilize Batman's legendary stealth. You will grapple, glide, and hang from the highest perches and darkest shadows, only to snatch up your enemies and dangle them by their toes, literally. This is kept even more interesting with multiple gadgets and upgrades as you progress. Trust me, you haven't lived until you've thrown a batarang across the asylum courtyard and switch the camera to the batarang's P.O.V. only to have it nail some whack job in the head. The game is loaded with little nuances like this if you take the time to play around and explore.

The first half of Arkham Asylum is flawless. The pacing is perfect with just the right mix of action and investigation around every corner. I found myself frothing at the mouth to find the next Riddler trophy, and even more so to gain access to a new area on the island. The cinematics are great, especially those leading up to the showdown with Poison Ivy (who is by far the toughest foe in the game). It's the second half of Arkham Asylum that starts to lose steam, and the pay-offs become less and less. It truly seems as if the developers just ran out of time towards the end. The ongoing battle with Killer Croc is one of the most redundant experiences in recent video game history, the pay-off for completing the Riddler challenges is nearly nonexistent, the final battle with the Joker is absurd, and the game's ending is all of 45 seconds in length. Even the credits are uninspired and use the same six images and music track over and over again for twenty minutes.

And did I mention that you can't go back and view any of the sweet in-game cinematics? That doesn't even make sense for a game like this. One of the main reasons why I pre-ordered it was because of its awesome production value--the fact that Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill and Arleen Sorkin reprise their roles as the definitive voices of Batman, Joker and Harley Quinn, respectively. So I have to keep replaying the game to experience half the reason why I bought it? That's inexcusable and could have been easily fixed with an update patch or some free downloadable content.

Ah, yes... downloadable content. For a game that boasted a good amount of ongoing downloadable content, Batman: Arkham Asylum had exactly two downloads. Are you kidding me? The possibilities for downloadable expansions were endless. How about adding a level or two to the main game as side quests (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil-5/dp/B0029ZBZ0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil 5</a>)? More Riddler challenges perhaps? Maybe have a combat challenge that includes a real fight with Harley or Killer Croc? Hell, maybe be able to play as Harley or Killer Croc in a combat challenge? Extra gadgets? Different batsuits (yes, there is one new armored outfit after you complete the game once, but come on... we're talking about Batman)? A theatre mode that allows us loyal fans to view the damn cut scenes by themselves? Gee, are we worth that much, Warner Brothers?

I digress.

So for what could have been in my top three favorite console games of all-time, Batman: Arkham Asylum instead takes the number five slot in my favorite Xbox 360 games. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, and I highly recommend it if for no other reason than just to finally experience a great Batman video game. There's so much there to like, but dammit, there's so much more they could have given us! It's like tasting a big spoonful of hot fudge sundae, and then your given three scoops of vanilla ice cream. It's good, but where's the hot fudge, nuts and cherry?

I was surprised at Christmas to get this game from my wife. She has a habit of doing those things. I was very unsure about playing any of this type of game on the Wii as I had tried Final Fantasy and it was horrible. I had assumed that I would only be using my Wii for such games as Carnival Games, Carnival Golf, The Fit and a few others, and that the real games would be played on the PC like all of the other hundreds I've played over the years.

When I finally decided to give it a try, I was very pleasantly surprised. Admittedly, I was never a PS2, XBox Wii gamer so I did not, and do not, get the grasp of their wacky controls. Most young gamers today, they know the controls like Democrats know how to spend. So I was at a disadvantage from the start having only the skill to press A or B and swing the WiiMote. So my first tip is, if your not used to playing games on the Wii or other similar platforms, get used to the controls first. Expect to die a lot, and expect to get frustrated until you master them, its not the game, its you.

With that aside, lets get into the game. As has been mentioned, the Tomb Raider franchise has been around for a while. I've played most of the PC versions in my day, hated some, loved others. The first thing that will impress you is the artwork and scenes are very well done. Are they 100% perfect, no, no game is, but the quality of screens, scenes, and art work is very high and impressive. I am absolutely thrilled with the Wii version in that Edios finally got back to the roots of the Tomb Raider games. They are puzzle games, not war games. If your looking for a lot of shooting and hanging from ropes blazing machine guns, and never getting 5 minutes to play and relax, this is not the game for you. In fact, game play although not a cake walk, is ralaxing at times, and trying at times. The whole game is a puzzle in that your always having to figure out where to go, and how to do it. The game is very intuitive in that there are hints everywhere so you would have to be fairly oblivious not too see where to go and what to do. You'll have to look for those clues, they are mostly pretty obvious. Sometimes, its a bit harder to see things, and sometimes there are multiple paths to take. But with the exception of one instance, even if you take the wrong path first, they all end up being part of the play, so in essence there are no wrong moves. Game play is very straight forward, and you cannot get into areas your not supposed to be yet until you follow a sequence of events first. No one should have any real difficulty finding their way around, finding the levers, puzzles, and traps needed to progress. There is enough of a challenge in all areas that only the most advanced gamers would feel that its too easy. I find that its more rewarding to be able to successfully traverse an area, or to activate something, or solve a puzzle without it being a major hassle each time which is a turn off. The game does get a little tougher as you play through the levels, and that's expected. There have also been comments about enimies, or the lack of them. I think this is a good move. As mentioned before, this is a puzzle game, you solve the way to go, you solve puzzles, you move things, you collect things, its not supposed to be all out warfare. I found the number of enimies to be just right. You will encounter mercinaries, Jaguar Thralls, Myan Thralls, and others. At no time did I find that the number of enimies I had to deal with was rediculous. At most I encountered 2 Thralls at a time, and 4 mercinaries on the ship. Once you master the controls, they are a challenge, but rewarding adversary that make the game interesting, yet does not turn you off because its rediculously hard. Another thing I liked a lot was not being attacked during a difficult part of the game like walking across a log high above a ravine or climbing up the side of a cliff etc. This maybe different for platforms other than the Wii, but this review is for the Wii version.

There are some cons to the game and I will list them here. Some I feel are legit, and others are just whining, and I'll address both. First of all, ALL versions of ALL games for ALL platforms, IE: Wii, XBox, PC, PS2 etc have bugs. They are unavoidable. Most of these are well known and published in multiple web sites. All that's needed is a Google search, and to read up a little before you start playing so you know how to avoid them or work around them. The one big bug in the Wii version is in the Coastal Thailand - Remnants level. In the beginning, do NOT swim near the doors under water in the pool at the beginning, this will cause the missing lever later on that opens those doors. The second is in the Southern Mexico - UnNamed Days level. If you do not go and inspect the first Myan puzzle first and trigger a cinematic sequence, it prevents the player from completing the second Myan puzzle. These are a pain, but nowhere near as bad as some of the bugs in other platform versions. Also, some have complained that the Wii version of the game is shorter and levels were omitted. This is not correct. The Wii version is just as large as any other, they just combined the Midgard Serpent level into the Land of the Dead so if you count the levels you would assume that its one level less, it is not. Game play may be longer in other versions, but the difference is neglegent. Also, others were disappointed at the number of relics, and treasures that Laura can find. They are less in quantity than on other platforms, and later in the game some of the treasures are very easy to find. Still, others are a great challenge, and others very difficult to get to. I'm not sure why there are less in the Wii version, probably due to the limitations of the platform that reduced the amount of things a player does in each level, but I found the amount satisfactory.

My cons are that the camera angles were about half the time horrible. There were parts were you had no choice but to see Laura from a distant corner or oddball angle. Other times your right on her back or arm, and moving the camera was at times fitfull and/or fruitless. The controls were also very finicky. This is a common complaint on the newer non-PC platforms along with the camera angle complaints. There are certain areas where the controls seem to have a mind of their own. You'll climb up quite a way in some chamber and have to jump back to a ledge or out cropping behind you, and even though you pull back on the numchuck and Laura looks behind her to jump, when you press the A button to jump Laura will jump sideways to her death. Its frustrating, but persistance pays off.

Over all, I think this game for Wii is a winner. I love the stunning art work and scenes. I like the game play, and the level of challenges. Some puzzles were rather easy, but getting to them was the other half of the challenge. The number of enimies you actually encounter at any one time was enough to give you some angst, but the number of them over all through the game, and the difficulty in eliminating them was not rediculous or unreasonable. More advanced gamers might want to consider another version, maybe for the PC, XBox or PS2 so there is a little more involved game play. If your looking for a lot of gun play, and fighting, you should choose a different game. I had a ton of fun playing this Wii version of Tomb Raider, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent game to play on the Wii.

Ever since Doom, each new game seems to be related to it  somehow, all of them set in space or in the future, having you battle it  out with hell spawn, or outlandish aliens.  With weapons consisting of  nothing more then hyper blasters and rocket launchers.  I got sick of this  overdone theme fast and longed for a 1st person shooter with a story, one  that captured me and consisted of more then just blowing up crap.
Then  came Outlaws, a diamond in the rough, a hidden gem amongst the piles of  other games that seemed to have everyones attention.  Outlaws plays out  like a classic spaghetti western.  It consists of a wonderfull story that  tells itself through handdrawn cutscenes and ingame action.  You are a US  Marshal, who has retired, but while away in town, outlaws set on vengence,  kill your wife and kidnap your daughter, making your retirement  shortlived.
This game was originaly released in late 1996 and met with  mixed reviews, most were to caught up in the phenomena known as Quake to  pay it any mind but for those that did not, boy did they miss out.  The  graphics are superb for it's time, and the music is out of this world.  The  weapons are simple, real world weapons from the times of Jesse James and  Billy the Kid.  You can't shoot forever and you actually have to reload.  This game takes skill and stealth.  I have played through the single play  mode countless times enjoying it more and more each time.
After you are  done with single player make sure to take advantage of the wonderfull  multi-player modes.  Outlaws plays well online with a 28.8 modem and is  supported on Microsoft's, zone.com.  It also is a great game for any lan  party or the network at work.  It is easy to start up and easy to play.  There are many different modes to try, deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture  the flag, and an original game called kill the fool with the chicken.  It  also developed a pretty big on-line community with many new custom maps  always being created leading to endless replayability.  Outlaws also has  customizable taunt files you can bind to the f-keys.  This realy adds to  the game enabling you to yell out insults to your oponents.  You can even  record or import your own voice or clips from movies or what ever you can  think of.

Lets be real. Today, eat console game you see that has a sports theme, besides one made by Nintendo, sports a medicore soundtrack, same dark and bland color theme, and does esentially the same thing.

A developer created a game that is upbeat, positive, and extremely entertaining without using blood, gore, evil, or anything negetive found in most games now adays. Dont get me wrong, I am an advid Silent Hill Fanatic so I know my share of dark games, but sometimes you want to explore the polor opposite of things and Jet Grind Radio Future is always an awesome way to do it.","I gaming Experience, not just a game.",1170979200,17,,

It definitely has a nice throwback feel to it.  In fact, I loved it so much, I purchased this game for three different systems.  It started for the Wii.  Then, I bought it for my iPod touch.  I kept waiting for Sonic 4 (Episode 2) to be released on the Wii, only to learn that it wasn't going to happen.  That's my excuse for buying it on Steam.

What it is, is about 10 to 12 hours (depending on play-style) of storytelling mixed with gameplay. Once the action beats start they are plentiful and well orchestrated.

The decisions Ready at Dawn made in which cinematics and gameplay are seamless have split the gaming community. Some don't mind, some think more shooting less talking, some feel it should be somewhere in-between.

I believe that the blend is just right. I was satisfied with the game and the time I spent with it. Would I have paid premium for the privilege? No, since there is no replay value in the product. There are no skill trees, no MP, no horde mode, not even a new game plus.
That, in my opinion is this games worst offense. Not giving the player incentive to come back for more. So, why the 5 star rating then? I feel the entire package, taken as whole warrants this.

I'm very glad I did as it's an outstanding game, challenging but lots of fun. The graphics are excellent but not as good as what's coming out now on the PS4. I bought it for $15 as Xbox as lowered the price since their  360 games won't play on the new Xbox One. We currently have both a xBox 360 and PS3. I decided to only buy the PS4 this go around because Sony let's you play your old games on their new systems which xBox does not. So at that price this game is definitely worth the price as you'll get a solid 50 hours of fun play out of it.

The game has you and friends land on an island where you are captured by bad guys, really bad guys. You have to escape and then try to save your friends. Some islanders help you but the fighting is all on your own and there are some tough battles. You have to craft things from animals you kill and then collect better weapons. You'll always be heavily out numbered but using cover and tactics you can win the battles. There are a few more cut scenes than I like, as I don't like cut scenes, but nothing to lessen the game's enjoyment.

For example, Hiro the Hero can use his hat as a boat while in the water.  He can also fish for sushi fish while riding in his hat.  The game is challenging but not too difficult.  There is a minimum of reflex button press sequences, and they are all well timed, so as to not be too difficult.

Most of the game is completely free roam, and there are lots of secrets to discover.  The game play is broad with different fighting styles, magic, and strategy.

-Lightweight and controllable without feeling cheap or insubstantial, the mouse is actually quite sturdy.  (It is also well balanced, not tail heavy).
-Durability.  I expect this mouse to last a very long time.
-Styling is sleek yet still classy in my book.  Many lighting options.
-Sensor is excellent! Supposedly it is the best on the market (same as G502) and I have no reason to challenge the notion after using it.
-Lift off distance is very good even before doing the sensor surface calibration routine.  I'd say just over half a CD width, which is awesome.
-All buttons have a precise, tactile feel.  All buttons have a light actuation point and short travel.
-Software is easy to use with many features I may never even use.
-Scroll wheel is very precise and is rubberized.  Does not feel cheap as with other Logitech mice.
-Finally, a good Logitech mouse with a braided cord...

The Middle Ground:
-Suitable for claw grippers (like me) with nice ergonomics for the fingers.
-Most of the mouse surfaces are plastic with little in the way of texture, hardly memorable.  I prefer the feel of the G400s hydrophobic surface.
-Mouse is rather wide.  Many will prefer the shape of a standard mouse to the wide base.  Best holding with claw grip off to side instead of front.
-Side buttons are set somewhat high.  This prevents accidental actuation but means that your thumb's travels are a little more conscious.

Cons:
-Software infrequently glitches and loses your DPI key mapping.  Unsure what set of circumstances cause it.  Minor annoyance and easily fixed.
-Coming from a G400s with 8 buttons, I rather miss having another button forward of the scroll wheel.  Minor point.

Previous mice:
Sharrk Gaming Mouse:  Great price, good mouse overall, crap ergonomics.
Utech 7200:  Lots of features but bad experience with sensor, poor ergonomics.
Logitech G510:  Wireless mouse, too heavy for FPS games.
Logitech G400s:  Excellent mouse but best suited for palm grip and a touch heavy for my taste.
Logitech G100:  Excellent mouse with very light weight but not enough buttons.
MSI DS100:  Excellent mouse with good feel and low profile for claw. Slightly heavy.  No real issues other than the wife adopting it:)
Logitech G303:  Light mouse with decent number of buttons, superb sensor and good ergonomics/styling.  A winner and a good value.",This is a Winner.,1440288000,,,

=Graphics=

The graphics are waaay better than Gamecube, but not as good as Xbox. 8.5/10

=Number of Games and Their Quality=

Playstation2 has the best games and more games than Xbox and Gamecube. 10/10

=Number and Quality of Controllers=

Playstation 2 has the best handling of controller, better than Xbox and waaay better than Gamecube, however there are only 2 controller ports and you cannot store memory in the controllers. 7.25/10

=Loyal Games=

PS2 has many loyal games that either come out for PS2 first, or don't go over to other consoles. There are Tekken, Grand Theft Auto, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy, and Kingdom Hearts, and maybe even more. However, alot of the games went to other platforms. Tekken went to GBA, GTA went to GBAC, GBASP, Xbox, Dreamcast, and PC, Gran Turismo went to GBA, and one of the Final Fantasys went to GC, so they aren't very loyal to PS2. 08/10

=Other Generation Gameplay=

Playstation 2 can play PS1 games, wheras for the Xbox cannot play PC games and Gamecube you must buy the Gameboy Player to play Gameboy games on it.

=The Future=

Plsyation 3 has been heard of for a long time, and so far it will have better graphics, and memory card storage to the controller.

=Online Gameplay=

This version of PS2 has a builtin online combo, so you don't have to buy an extra HDD!

Overall, I'd definitely tell you to buy this PS2 if you already don't have the original.

Sandoc,"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance has already been released for the PS2 months earlier, but this doesn't mean that the newly, ported version to the Xbox video game console should be ignored. Developer Snowblind Studios has seemlessly ported the PS2 version over to the Xbox and, using the Xbox's higher graphical processing power, made the game look even better. But graphics alone doesn't make a great a fun and great time for a gamer. This Xbox port also includes the great gameplay of the original PS2 version. The intuitive and easy-to-use control scheme remains intact.

Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance still allows a player to choose between three different types of player characters. One can either choose to be a dwarf warrior, a human ranger, or an elfin sorceress. Each type of character has their own advantages and disadvantages and all three could be used to go through the game and finish it. Though I learned after doing so that the best class to pick would be the elfin sorceress. Her high level of magic spells available to her in addition to being able to have some success using a melee weapon makes her slightly better overall. And for the prurient minded gamers out there, the elfin sorceress could be seen in all her near-nakedness glory in the menu-system.

The 3/4 top down viewpoint of the fight makes it easy for th eplayer not to be surprised by enemies and traps as he goes from one dungeon, cave system and, at time, overland area to the next. Similar to Blizzard's Diablo, BG:DA is pretty much the same game as that hack and slash, but using the 3rd edition rules of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons and its world of the Forgotten Realms. The city of Baldur's Gate and the surrounding region of the Sword Coast are done beautifully by the Snowblind developers. From the deep, underground mine tunnel complexes of the dwarves to the festering, swamp area of Chelimber.

The enemies are designed well and pretty much follows the description of the creatures in the many Forgotten Realms game books and novels. Whether its Umber Hulks, beholders, giants, displacer beasts, etc...the developers did their job well in bringing these varied and dangerous creatures of Faerun to life in BG:DA. Even the many different races introduced and used in the game follows their description in the FR books and guides. The dwarves speak with a heavy Scottish brogue, while elves, both high and dark speak in a high and might English-manner. The voice-acting in this game is also top-notch and I would say some of the best video game VA ever. There's not a false note with any of the spoken dialogue and that just makes the game much more immersive.

Overall, Interplay and Snowblind Studios' Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is a great looking and very fun game to play. It's not as deep and rich as the straight-up rpg that the PC games int he series were well-known for. What Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance does bring is the themes and storytelling of the PC games but in a much more simple, hack and slash dungeon-crawl a la Diablo and Dungeon Siege.

Some of the puzzles in this installment are difficult.  Just a hint;  take care to record everything throughout the game, since the later solutions were found in seemingly obscure clues in other ages earlier in the game.  A nice touch on Revelation is the snapshot camera.  Potential clues to later puzzles can be photographed and a device keeps track of your snapshots.  Endlessly useful and allows for many less written notes than earlier Myst installments.  My problem was that I didn't record some key clues in the form of snapshots,  so I was missing this information later in the game.  My recommendation is:  take photos of everything.

I have spent many a nights playing these games and still I have not gotten tired of them. Corkscrew Follies offers a wide variety of new coaster types as well as new carnival rides. There are also many new shops to choose from such as my personal favorite the seafood stand that looks like an octopus!

At a surface level yes they are right, the graphics are the same and the menus are almost unchanged. BUT! when first playing this game, the full version not the demo, you can tell right away once you make the nice step over with Messi or bend that long shot with Beckham. It is so darn smooth and beautiful.

You can now do tricks that look so smooth and realistic that was impossible in 09. I beat 2 defenders with Drogba by sliding the ball on his back foot and the cutting it behind him to the other side and turned both defenders! Moments like that make you loved FIFA 10. Bending the ball now is more responsive so the finesse shot truly has finesse! The ball moves more realistic and when two players are running after a ball neck and neck there is no longer both of them just being locked together the whole time. The bigger guy will push one off or fast players will not only beat out the other player but sometimes go behind him and catch up on the other side.

I haven't yet tinkered with Manager mode much but I heard it's much more realistic now. You can no longer sign Cristiano Ronaldo to teams like Leeds United.

Online mode is 100 times better and less games drop and lag is greatly reduced.

So in conclusion:
Is this game nearly as groundbreaking as it's predecessor? Simple answer, no.
It is however a giant step forward into polishing 09 to excellent form. Can't wait for FIFA 2011.

Best example of the games:
FIFA 09 = Bojan (immense potential, not quite there yet)
FIFA 10 = Torres (almost...)
so hopefully we will get a true Messi or Ronaldo for FIFA 11","Perfect, over and over and over and over again!",1255996800,13,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

Summary: the keys predictably trigger at the same height across the entire keyboard. The trigger point is fairly early in the keystroke, which means your actions trigger quickly while gaming. This takes some getting used to when touch typing (chat in games, or general work type tasks), especially if you are used to cheaply made keyboards. It works exactly as advertised, is very solidly built, and you should get one if you can possibly afford it.

I've had one of these since they first came out, and I can say they are also quite reliable. Some of the keys have worn from a rough finish to a smooth one, but otherwise there is no sign of wear.

I also have an original Logitech G15 and a Razer Tarantula keyboard. The Logitech is decent quality, and is the best choice if you need programmable buttons and don't mind giving up about two square miles of desktop space. The Razer is a cheaply made keyboard whose primary selling point is that you can program macros into it and then use it in games where macros are banned. Neither is in the same league as the 7G mechanically.

At some point, I realized that what I really wanted was not programmable buttons or laser-cut glowing logos, but actual high quality keys that work really well, with no crappy third party software in between my keystrokes and the game. The 7G completely satisfies in every area. It is a full standard keyboard that is very very well built, and that is all it is.

Oh sure, you can push down every key on the keyboard at once, and they will all be registered, in order. It is solidly built and looks incredibly expensive on my desk. But the bottom line is that it does exactly what you want from a keyboard with no negatives except the price. And, is that so bad? I've spent almost that much on a mouse! Does a mouse have over a hundred gold-plated switches in it? I think not.

[edit] I've been using this keyboard for two years now (really?!) and some of the keys are now smooth on top from repeated pressing instead of rough. Otherwise it looks and works like the day I got it. If something happened to it, I'd buy another 7G to replace it.

[update 2 - late spring 2013]

The Alt and Windows key keycaps have come loose. They stay on during normal gaming, so it's not a major issue, but it's annoying when cleaning or moving the keyboard around. the vacuum cleaner's brush will knock them right off. Am considering contacting SS to see if they have fixed the issue/will sell replacement key caps.

Otherwise it's still the best keyboard I own, still works 100%, and is the core of my gaming rig.",...And I've tried them all.,1284940800,,,

I've had this charging station for about a month and half and so far there have been no problems and I love it!

PROS:
1. NO MORE BATTERIES!
2. Lasts for hours & hours
3. Charges pretty quickly
3. Great place to store your Wiimotes (eliminates clutter)
4. Has a rubber bad for extra 'grippage'
5. Fits into the design of the Wii and Wiimotes
6. Has cool neon blue and green lights
7. NO MORE BATTERIES!

CONS:
1. It's a bit difficult to get Wiimote in the stand correctly
2. Doesn't work with the Wii Remote Jacket
3. Takes up more room
4. Has to be plugged into a wall outlet

Despite the cons (which are very minimal), I really think this Nyko charging station is great.

5.0,False,"10 8, 2000",A2DAAPYZTJ9PZA,B00004XOM2,C. Moon,"Before I start gushing about the greatness of this game, a word of warning is in order.  If you already picked up second impact for the DC you may wish to either hold off on this title or trade-up for it (the latter being my personal take as 3rd strike offers a lot that 2nd impact does not.)
Well, where to start?  Street fighter 3 is a visual treat, completely inseperable from playing an anime.  The characters have so much animation it is really stunning.  For all the people who whined about it taking so long for SF3 to show up--this is why: the technology wasn't there immediately to do what they have accomplished with the SF3 series which is to make the most beautiful 2D game ever.
Gameplay is of course exactly where it should be.  Ultra-tight controls and deep game play.  Some people have complained that SF3 slows down the pace considerably from the alpha series, and by removing air blocking, has in fact gone backwards, however this makes SF3 much less spastic and more rewarding in the long run.  Capcom has not forgotten its fan base however, and much of these features can be altered.
It also seems worth mentioning that 3rd strike includes a relatively large roster of characters--19!  I know that doesn't stand up to Marvel vs. Capcom2, but if you compare what's really being offered you'll find that the characters in games like MvC2 are mere shadows of their SF3 counterparts.  Here the characters feel as though they do in fact exist--as though they have weight and behave in a realistic fashion (well, beyond throwing fireballs!)  Given the degree of work that must have gone into every character here, 19 seems like a lot!  What's more, beyond tweleve, there doesn't seem to be a weak character in the lot.  Pretty impressive given that early SF games often suffered from characters being unbalenced in strength.
I also want to mention the sound on this game which is well above normal Capcom standards.  It isn't that I am a big fan of hip-hop, but this makes the game infinitely more cool.  I mean, we are talking Street Fighter, not Office Fighter.  Enough of the sterile synthisizer soundtracks.  All the fighting scenes have great musical backdrops, but even better are the short rap numbers that accompany all the inbetween scenes.  There is a rap song for selecting your character, a very short one while you choose who you will fight ('check it out now, third strike y'all'), and plenty of others.  This definitely ups the cool factor way above 2nd impact!
OK, here is the BIG difference and the reason why you'll want to get this even if you have second impact.  3rd Strike can be completely modified.  I've toyed around with this a bit, turning on chain combos, air blocking, etc. and really turned 3rd strike into a completely different game.  This ability to get under the hood of the Street Fighter engine puts 3rd strike up there with Alpha 3 in its awesome potential for replayability.  If you choose, now you can have all three supers available at the same time, use chain combos, cancel super arts into other super arts...  Its all up to you.  There is even enough here to keep the Marvel vs. Capcom fan happy as you can make the game quite spastic if you feel the urge.
All in all, this is one of those top-tier games for the dreamcast that really makes owning the system a necessity for fighting game fans.","Check it out now, third strike y'all!",970963200,5,,

5.0,False,"10 15, 2010",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B002BS47TE,Lisa Shea,"A sequel to the PSP's earlier ""Portable Ops"", MGS: Peace Walker is a surprising technical improvement when compared against earlier games. Focusing on the management of a larger mercenary organization, ""Peace Walker"" still has its share of stealth-based tactical action.

Peace Walker returns to the world of Big Boss, rather than the series' usual protagonist, Solid Snake. In the period between Portable Ops and now, Big Boss has left the US government and assembled his own mercenary team, the MSF. Peace Walker centers around managing the MSF by carrying out missions, recruiting new members, developing new technologies, and building up the off-shore platform used as the MSF's main base.

Gameplay is divided into story missions (main ops) and side missions (extra ops). The main ops constitute normal gameplay, broken up into segments. The extra ops are closer to the VR missions from MGS2 - short, timed scenarios with some twist or quirk to them, like ""rescue the hostage"" or ""find the mines"". Mission maps are wider and more detailed than in Portable Ops, and many missions take place in an area consisting of several connected maps, which makes the world seem larger. There are a lot of areas that are wooded or swampy, which calls back to MGS3 and its more natural environments. Another MGS3-like feature is the lack of a ""standard"" radar - items like sonar must be equipped in the item slot and have limited battery life, making players more reliant on their own senses to spot enemies.

Managing the MSF is one of the game's major features. New recruits can be captured in the field either by subduing enemies or rescuing hostages. These recruits have a diverse set of stats, and can be assigned to different units, like combat, R&D, or intelligence in a manner similar to Portable Ops. Unlike Portable Ops, every recruit wears the basic MSF uniforms; there's no difference between capturing a guard or a sniper. Characters are instead distinguished by portraits and codenames, both of which are randomly assigned. This allows for some level of identification, although it unfortunately doesn't carry over to actual gameplay. Every character is now represented by a generic masked figure (male or female) except for Snake himself. However, there are different costumes and camouflage uniforms (all of which have masks), and the uniforms have different stealth values and inventory slots. This allows for different types of gameplay depending on the uniform selected.

Bosses come in two main types: vehicles and mechs. Vehicles consist of things like tanks and helicopters. Vehicle fights often involve supporting troops - if they're out of the way, the vehicle's commander can be incapacitated or killed and the vehicle can be captured for MSF's usage. Mech fights are more traditional MGS boss fare; instead of capturing them, however, it's possible to salvage parts and AI cores to build your own mech. Both vehicles and mechs can be sent off (along with troops) to missions in other parts of the world. These ""Outer Ops"" are automatically resolved, but provide a way for the majority of your combat forces to get experience (since only one person can sneak at a time).

Peace Walker focuses a lot on multiplayer, as well. There's a fairly standard versus mode, but the main attraction of multiplayer is a cooperative mode. This allows for players to attempt missions, or even fight bosses, in groups of up to four. However, multiplayer is limited to nearby PSPs - there's no online match-making mode or anything of the sort, despite the presence of pre-written communication (which should only really be useful if you can't talk to the person in real life). The relative rarity of the PSP means that this feature will most likely go unused.

Overall, Peace Walker does a lot of things right that Metal Gear should do right. The bosses are fun, the environments are detailed, and the controls are tight enough to not be a problem. It's not quite the second coming of MGS3, detail-wise, but it's definitely a worthy successor, considering its handheld status. The management aspect is fun and addictive, though the actual logistics of the whole thing could have used some fleshing out. Peace Walker is a solid game both for fans of the series and for those who aren't usually interested in it.

Beautiful graphics, incredibly fast gameplay, and plenty of single-player action make this the ultimate portable fighter. Choosing from over 16 of the original Street Fighter cast-no SFIII or Alpha characters here-you battle in the classic one-on-one style with three turbo speeds and the ""beat-up-the-car"" and ""barrel-busting"" mini-games. You can also unlock several cool single-player modes, like survival, timed attack, beat the bosses, and fight Akuma-but this game is best when you're battling another player via the link cable. The 2D sprites are smoothly animated and the backgrounds are awesomely detailed as the GBA's wide screen is filled to the edges with frantic action. Controls are dead-on with a simple four-button setup (as in Marvel vs. Capcom 2), and the GBA is reminiscent of the old Super NES controller (hopefully the GBA shoulder buttons will hold out). Big-handed gamers, however, may find their fighting endurance severely shortened by the minute size of the GBA-i.e., ""hand cramp!"" The soundtrack is standard SF fare, but some sounds are distorted, while other small bits are missing.
This game brings you back to a time when Street Fighter was the unrivalled king of the fighting genre, and now the series will reign again on the GBA.

First, make sure you download the 100mb patch before you start playing. Any save games you make will be incompatible with the patch, and the patch fixes a TON of bugs. It sort of makes you wonder about the QC process, if this was released on the same day as the software was. But in any case, at least they fixed the problems quickly.

The game is classic good-bad choices from Peter Molyneux - the creator of fantastic open ended games where you can choose your own destiny. In B&WII this is very much a combination of Creatures and Age of Empires. You are building up your town - placing buildings to please the villagers, tending farms, mining ore. You are also training your creature to be responsible - watering the gardens, entertaining the villagers. That being said you can instead choose to be an evil overlord - starving your villagers, taking over nearby towns, causing destruction.

The first B&W really went overboard on the creature micro-management. You were more of a creature nanny than a God. Some people might have enjoyed that - and there are certainly enough NintenDogs and NeoPet games out there to soothe those people who want to spent 24 hrs a day raising a pet. I really found it quite tedious to sit there slapping and petting an animal, when I was a god with a civilization to build. I'm thrilled that they have the whole creature thing much more reasonable. It still takes your attention to set the creature on its path, but you don't have to spend hours on it. You're a God after all.

By the same token, if you're looking for a high end killer war - strategy game, this just isn't it. This isn't meant to be like a Command & Conquer or other war engine. War is an aspect of the game, yes, but you are encouraged to bring in people by impressing them just as much as by conquering them.

The graphics are of course stellar. There are tons of villagers, each with his or her own name, personality and job, wandering around the village doing tasks. Each tree and flower can be interacted with individually. The sounds are reasonable, with a nice soundtrack that isn't hard to listen to repeatedly as you go through the game using different creatures and aiming for different alignments.

The shining essence of this game is of course the choices you make. As you make evil creatures, the world gets more and more grim through each level - and your creature begins to look really violent and depraved. If you choose to make good creatures, the world reacts to that quite amazingly, and your creature reflects those choices. Even the ground on which he / she walks reflects that nature.

In the end, you could probably play through the game in 1-2 days, on a single pass. But the fun in the game is to replay it with different creatures and different aims, to see how it affects your world. In this sense it's very much like Fable, a game that was amazingly fun to replay. I found this an extremely well balanced game between the town building, creature taming and god-like powers.

I then found myself spending the next month slogging through 30 delicious missions of special forces fun.  Now, don't get me wrong, it's not perfect.  I ran into some pathfinding problems (guys getting stuck in stairwells, or jumping off a 6-inch drop, rather than taking a ramp, and breaking their legs no less), and it is annoying that my guys never used their grenades.  But they were certainly quick on the draw, regularly taking out enemy soldiers before I could even spot them, let alone draw a bead.
Maps are nicely varied and large, graphics and sound are solid, and the control scheme is not nearly as difficult to learn as I thought it would be (although it does take some practice, and the tutorial is kinda stinky).  But the thing that amazed me most is that just about every mission contains a lot of NOTHING happening.  You're moving soldiers into position, looking around for the bad guys, wondering if you should take the high road or not and then BAM! BAM! RAT-A-TAT-TAT!  The sudden (usually short) bursts of violence just mde the lack of action unbelievably intense.

Beetlejuice is a very unique game and fun to play. It has quickly become one of my favorite games for the NES because of its fun gameplay and challenge.

The game consists of 5 levels which seems short but the difficulty makes it a much longer game. You can only get hit 3 times and are given only 3 continues. If you die or get a continue, you will return to the last spot you stood before dying. You play as Beetlejuice in a series of sidescrolling and top-view levels. In the sidescrolling levels, you can get points by killing some enemies. Many of the enemies are indestructible but there are many bug holes throughout the levels in which you can enter or stomp the small bugs that come out. By crushing these bugs with the B button you get points ranging from 10 to 75.

Bug Points:
Red = 10
Blue = 25
Green = 50
Yellow = 75

If you enter the hole instead, there are 3 different enemies you may encounter. A ghost which takes one hit and gives you 10 points, a giant skull which takes 15 hits and gives you 75 points per hit, or 6 flying skulls which each take one hit worth 75 points each. The flying skulls fly in a random pattern and are very difficult to defeat. There may also be a poison bottle in the holes which gives you 450 points.

If you enter the hole, you cannot exit until all the enemies are defeated. If you enter the hole, bugs will cease to come out.

You can spend the points you gather by going into shops located behind doors in sidescrolling levels. There are several scares for sale which are attacks Beetlejuice uses on certain enemies and bosses. Each scare costs different points and give Beetlejuice different attacks. If you get your third hit while using a scare, your hit counter resets so you can use this to get extra hits before dying. You can only have 9 of each item including lives.

Scares:
Medusa head - 100 points - Can fire 1 shot and freezes flying skulls which appear in holes.
Birdman - 150 points - Can fire 2 shots and also makes Beetlejuice jump higher.
Skeleton - 250 points - Can fire 5 shots, can destroy bee hives and makes Beetlejuice immune to bees.
Two-Headed man - 200 points - Can fire 3 shots and defeats Sandworm in 1 shot.
Umbrella Head - 400 points - Can fire 9 shots
Ogre - 500 points - Can fire 12 shots and defeats Cavern Monster (giant frog) in 1 shot
Spooksheet - 600 points -  Can fire 15 shots
Snakeman- 750 points - Can fire 19 shots
Extra Life - 1250 points - Gives Beetlejuice one more life.

There are bosses at the end of each sidescrolling level. Every boss can take an infinite amount of hits. The only way to defeat them is to hit them into a wall. If you run out of scares during a boss fight, you will return to the beginning of the stage after you die.

The top view levels are the hardest part of the game. Here, you cannot purchase scares or lives. Instead, there are scares hidden in boxes throughout the level, some of which contain keys to progress or enemies, so beware. Each scare is the same and can kill any enemy except insects and what I believe is a flying knife. There are also items which you can pick up and use via the select button. A hammer, a fly swatter, a toilet paper roll (which is useless), a brick (also useless), and various items to give to characters blocking doorways. There are alternate paths and if you take the wrong direction, or if a flying door touches you, you are taken to a penalty level with a sandworm. The sandworm can kill you in one hit, but the level contains one random scare and if you run out of scares, it will provide you with another one. If you defeat the sandworm, you are taken back to the spot where you entered.

The controls are somewhat slippery which is what makes the game so difficult. The jumping seems to be too exaggerated and while on the ground, there is no momentum. If you let go of a direction while running you will instantly stop. This doesn't happen while you're in the air which takes some getting used to.

The screen does not follow Beetlejuice while he's in the air and this can cause you to die. If you touch the bottom of the screen, even if there is a platform just below it, you will lose a life. The screen is a little slow at following you while on the ground which could be trouble if there are enemies nearby.

Overall, there are a few problems with this game that adds to the difficulty, but it is not too bad and actually makes the challenge all the more fun. By trying to work against the game's problems and succeeding makes your victory in the end all the more sweet. The large amount of scares makes the game very unique and gives the player the freedom to explore and try different tactics to beat the game. The variety of levels keeps the game from being just another NES platformer and makes the game more fresh. I have continued to replay this game and every time it ends, I feel like playing it all over again. It is a fun game and I highly recommend it, though casual players may want to stay away from this one until they are ready to face the challenge that is Beetlejuice.",Unique and Fun but Only If You Know What To Do,1388620800,2,,

5.0,False,"09 15, 2008",ABIVKBMSIPEDY,B001BDI9SU,Kiyo M.,"When it comes to gaming headsets, the sound quality is usually really disappointing when using it for other than... well, gaming (since it is optimized for it). However, the Creative Gaming headset is quite impressive even for listening to music and movies!

The Creative Fatal1ty USB Gaming Headset (aka HS-1000), also has a wireless version called the HS-1200. However, besides the obvious looks and wireless factor, they both actually sound completely different too. Even though they have the same audio specs (20Hz ~ 20kHz, 40mm Neodymium drivers, Impedance: 32ohm), there's a more secluded dynamic feel with this HS-1000; like being in a theater room, whereas the HS-1200 is more of a direct, sharper, like being out in the open, sound to the ear. Both are good in their own ways, but this HS-1000 headphone is definitely much nicer when it comes to comfort -- without a doubt -- and overall, better for other than gaming (music/movies).

Compared to the small, practically fixated cups on the wireless HS-1200, this one is a lot nicer to wear, simply because the headphones can also adjust/twist slightly inward or outward; this is not possible with the HS-1200 (when most headphones should be able to). I can actually wear this headphone for hours, but not with the HS-1200. However, I wouldn't say it's extremely comfortable to the point where I won't be able to tell that I'm wearing it; I have the headphones extended all the way out (it doesn't really go out that much compared to other headphones that extend at ridiculous lengths), but it's still slightly on the tighter side that it won't fall off even if I shake my head. If you know you have a large head, then these may be too tight for you.

The headphone is Plug-and-Play (I'm using Windows XP), but you'll want to install the Creative Software to take advantage of the extra features like the X-Fi Crystalizer and CMSS-3D -- it actually does make a major difference in sound.

When I opened the package for the very first time, my first impression on the build quality, to be honest, wasn't something I was blown away by. It kind of haunted me of the cheap build quality on the Creative Fatal1ty 1010 Gaming Mouse. However, after using it and staring at it for quite some time now, it's actually not too bad (my expectations might have been high); it's not awfully cheap looking, but it's definitely not high quality material. Although they always make it look super shiny in the stock photos, it is just plain plastic. However, I figured it's a good thing, since it does make the headphone lightweight. The red Fatal1ty logo area does add some spunk to it, at least.

I also own the SteelSeries 4H headphones (priced quite close to this one), but Creative's gaming headset -- no question -- has a much more impressive sound.

Pros:
- Clear, secluded surround sound.
- Not just for games. Music and movies sound just as great!
- Connects via USB (no need to plug into audio/microphone)
- Wire is only on the left side of the headphone, which I can live with (a lot less annoying than two wires dangling on each side!)
- Microphone can be detached completely (this could be a problem, though, if you forget where you left it)
- Clear microphone output. Comes with foam cover to reduce unwanted noise (the HS-1200 didn't come with one).
- Headphone cushions (keeps my ears and head warm)
- Comes with a travel bag.

Cons:
- Could have used a mute button on the in-line volume controls.
- Slightly inconvenient having to restart certain applications (or games) if the headphones aren't connected before (no sound). [But I'm sure this is a common problem with any USB audio devices]

Even if you don't play games, I would actually still recommend this gaming headset for just listening to music/movies, as well as voice chatting. I didn't think I would give this product a 5-star, but I have to admit, it impressed me.",Pretty impressive sound - not just for games. HS-1000 vs. Wireless HS-1200,1221436800,,,

The traditional rpg turn based battling is back, but with a twist. Mario must depend on stickers he collects throughout the world's to attack. That means you must collect an abundance of hammers, jump stickers and all sorts of other stickers with different powers and abilities, which really adds a lot of depth to the game and a whole lot of strategy for each battle. Though I never actually ran out of stickers, so you are supplied with enough to not get stuck. You get a sticker book to keep all your stickers in which gets expanded throughout the game. The more powerful stickers take up more room, so you can actually stick the stickers in the best way possible on the pages to fit the most stickers.
You can also use real life items like a fan or scissors that have humorous effects on your paper enemies. Boss fights are really fun as well.
  The most notable difference about this game compared to the first two in the series is there is now a world map similar to that in Super Mario Bros 3 & World. You have to beat each level to advance to the next one, but have to constantly revisit stages to solve puzzles and advance the story. Each World has about 6-10 stages and are filled with hidden goals and other secrets to unlock new paths.
  The difficulty of the game is just right, though I got stuck a lot. The puzzles in this game are very difficult and clever and I had a hard time figuring them out, resorting to a guide for most of the game.
  As far as putting it in a line up with the other games in the series, I would order them...

5.0,True,"05 19, 2011",A1F0R0N400FPWD,B003ZHMMEM,JT,"CONCEPT:
Just as the name suggests, ""Donkey Kong Country Returns"" is an updated version of the beloved platforming series from the SNES. The story line is very familiar as once again Donkey Kong has been robbed of his banana treasure stash. Only this time it's not the Croc's who are the enemies but a mysterious brainwashing group of Tiki creatures.

GRAPHICS:
As I'm sure you've seen in still pics and game trailers this game is truly one of the most gorgeous to grace the Wii. Retro Studios has been known for their attention to detail, and on DKCR the game designers do not disappoint. The diversity between levels is also stunning, (I especially like the silhouette stage). The creativity implemented into each and every different stage makes this game retain all the charm of the original games.

SOUND DESIGN:
Obviously there are songs from the original game that appear in the soundtrack, (it just wouldn't be the same without that sweet jungle theme). They've been updated, remixed and compliment the atmosphere of the game nicely. The ambient sounds blend great to the backdrop of the level. Action sounds are clean, crisp, and very responsive I love when DK slams down his massive fists and my sub kicks out a double low thud...

CONTROLS:
At first using both the nunchuck and remote simultaneously seemed a little unneccesary and excessive for a platforming game. A few levels in though I realized there were many different movements implemented into the game. This really helped to change things up and make gameplay a lot less repetitive. Unfortunately this complicates the mechanics and there are just certain times where the controls are well... a lil' bit clumsy. Nothing bad enough to hold back this title, but this is after all a review so it does bear mentioning.

ENTERTAINMENT:
This game is loads of fun for fans of the platforming genre, in fact I'll go so far as to say this game would have a place in the top 5 Greatest Platformers Ever. The levels are difficult and sometimes even mentally challenging, the bosses are tricky and YOU WILL have a hard time completing this game. Although it can be played as a 2 player game, I found it to be extremely limiting for whoever was controlling Diddy.

REPLAY VALUE:
HIGH
Lots and lots of hidden puzzle pieces, K-O-N-G letters, time trials, unlockable levels... yea I'd say this game has a load of replay value to it, on top of the fact that the levels are fun to play. Mine Carts, Rocket Barrels... etc.

OVERALL
One of the best games of 2010 on any console and perhaps THE best Wii release last year. A must play for fans of the franchise, Donkey Kong Country delivers both a fun and challenging game. I highly recommend this title as it will keep you entertained for weeks, especially if you want to achieve 100% completion.

Little to my knowledge one of my friends was paying attention and then *bam* there it was out of the blue...literally the box it blue...(just kidding) there it was, he had bought it and gave it to me as Christmas early, said if he hadn't he'd have ended up opening it up and playing it.  I wouldn't have blamed him either, the device is amazingly small, much, much smaller than the one I bought with a slide open lid, something more becoming of the original ps1 or ""thin"" ps2 but with darn near 10 times the space inside.  The technology has also improved, having wifi @ my home I'd occationally have a decent enough signal to pull up hulu or amazon prime on the ps3 but it would always have buffering problems.  The new one has little to no problems, streaming video with ease, and with the addition of an HDMI cable (sold separately) connecting to my TV...wow the quality of the games, of the movies and blue ray discs...

5.0,False,"01 13, 2008",A39VKDG484JXXA,B000WNXYLM,H. E. Paul,"First let me describe a little bit about my background. I own a 32"" CRT TV, a Dolby 6.1 surround sound system, a Playstation 1 and 2. My Xbox purchase was a last-minute over-the-budget purchase after I had already budgeted for Christmas. About a week before Christmas I learned that 2 of my brothers-in-law were getting a 360 for Christmas and my wife's aunt and uncle in California already had a unit. So I was under intense peer pressure to say the least to join the Xbox madness.

Up until this time, I was not interested in any of the current gen systems other than a Wii because of some preconceptions that I had. I thought that I would need a hi-def TV to take full advantage of my system. I thought that I would have to upgrade my stereo system if I wanted to use HDMI. As I did a little research, I found this not to be the case at all. In fact, I was really quite amazed at how nice the 360 looks and sounds being connected to an old beater 25"" TV that is 10 years old.

So, I decided to take the plunge. My DVD player was dying and I thought Xbox Live might be a good way to keep in touch with remote family members who also have Xbox 360 units. I figured $75 of the cost of the unit I could justify by using the system as a DVD player, at least initially. I decided to get the Elite system for a few reasons. The first reason was for price. In the kit you get the 120gb hard drive, the standard component / a/v cable combo connector, an HDMI cable and the audio out cable to use in conjunction with the HDMI cable. The cost difference alone by including the HDMI kit and the 120gb is greater than the $100 additional cost for the elite system. My current CRT TV has component inputs so I am using the component cable set on standard-def (there is a switch on the side to select hi-def) and optical out for audio to my stereo. If I decide to get an HDTV, I can use the HDMI cable for video and use the optical audio out cable to run to my stereo. I don't have to upgrade my stereo receiver to utilize my stereo in the setup.

Xbox Live has turned out to be a complete blast! I absolutely love all of the features that you can do with it. You can download movie and tv show trailers in addition to supplemental game content and game trailers. You can also download full movies and tv shows by paying for them with points, so you can skip a trip to the video store if you would rather do direct downloads. I also linked in my Windows Live messenger account and I can do text, voice, and video chat with friends on my contact list in addition to players I meet online. It's been a total blast keeping in touch with friends and relatives that the experience is easily worth the $50 / year. You can actually find subscription cards that give you 12 months with 1 free and sometimes they are on sale for $45. My deck had a 1 month trial for a gold level Live account.

I was actually torn for the longest time between a PS3 and an Xbox 360. There were several factors that swayed my decision to the Xbox. The major ones were the interactivity on Live, the ability to play simpler arcade games through live (some of the ones available are the old-school Dig-Dug, Double Dragon, and DOOM, plus countless puzzle, card, and skill games), hardware availability and functionality, comfort and styling of the controllers, and the available library of games.

My unit has had near continual use since I bought it nearly a month ago. We play all our DVDs on the system, we play games at least a couple hours per day, my wife uses it to chat with her relatives out of state (you can chat and communicate with a free included silver level Live account), and we have not had a single problem. One thing I do is I keep my unit on its side (mostly for space reasons) and I make sure there is plenty of space around the unit so that airflow is not restricted.

I love the wireless controllers. The controller has been redesigned from the original Xbox and it couldn't be a more comfortable controller to play with. I have large hands and my PS2 controllers would make my hands hurt after playing for a couple hours. I can play with these controllers for hours with no discomfort at all. The controllers also get great battery life. The included set of Energizers lasted about 3 weeks with heavy use. I have just begun using the play and charge cable with my battery pack. The cord is long, about 6' and has a standard USB connector, so you can actually use a PC or another device with powered USB ports to recharge your controller if you don't want the cord in the way while you play. The controller also has an LED ring divided into 4 quadrants, each with a number. The number of your controller is lit in its quadrant, so it's really easy to figure out what player number you are in a game.

For the cons, there is no included wi-fi adapter. The ""official"" adapter is a $99 accessory. If you need wi-fi and don't want to use this adapter, you can use a standard USB wi-fi game console adapter, or you can also use an Ethernet bridge connected to the wired network port on the unit. Both items can be found for about 1/2 the cost of the network adapter from Microsoft. I actually prefer the wired connector as I do a lot of downloading now and I get much better performance with the wired port, in addition to better security by not sending the data through the air. Since I haven't gone hi-def yet, I haven't bought into a hi-def format either. I really like how I have the ability to download HD content without having to buy it on disc first. This will let me take advantage of HD content while I wait for the format wars to come to an end, once I get an HDTV. An speaking of content, if you have an HTPC running Windows Media Center, the Xbox 360 can be configured as a Media Center Extender, so you can watch shows, view pictures, and listen to music that you have recorded on your HTPC over the network. If you do not have Media Center Edition, you can still view pictures and listen to music on a Windows XP or later PC after you download a patch to the system.

The unit is also loud. The cooling fans are not as loud as the disc drive unit. I have a good stereo so it's not hard to drown out the noise, but with a cheap TV the system noise could possibly be annoying.

I haven't played a lot of games yet as I blew my budget on the unit itself, but I have played the included Forza Racing and Marvel Ultimate Alliance. The Marvel game was fun to play, because I bought it for my PS2 so I had a title to compare with. The Xbox 360 just blew me away by how great it looks and sounds on cheap supporting hardware. I can only imagine what the experience must be like in HD. My 6.1 system keeps the windows rattling with explosions for now.

While I haven't had hardware issues with this system yet, I have suffered them in the past. It took a class action suit with Sony to give me justice for the pain suffered over my PS2. The fact that Microsoft has a great warranty and is willing to work with us on problems is encouraging.

All in all, I'm really impressed with this system. My 360 is on track to get far more use than my PS2 ever did. I can't believe just how much ""fun"" this system is to play with.",Pleasantly Pleased,1200182400,2,{'Edition:': ' Elite'},

Belmont's Revenge uses a Mega Man style platform where you can pick your own stage.  But it still has all the Castlevania feel and atmosphere to it.

The game has a good length overall for the time period it came out in and all 7 stages were interesting and challenging in their own way.  The sub weapons are back missing from Castlevania Adventure and they really add a lot to the game.  The story is pretty good and I love how you get to fight your son Soryu at the end of stage 6.  Dracula is no breeze in this game and you will likely die several times before you figure out the pattern to beat him.  In Castlevania Adventure that game moved at a snail's pace, but in Belmont's Revenge you can speed through the game pretty quickly.  I completed the whole game in 33 minutes sitting in a car waiting for somebody.

Everything about this game was very well done.  The music and backgrounds had a lot of nice detail and  the bosses of each stage were unique and fun to battle.  The Dragon boss in particular was a very cool element to this game going through the floor and ceiling.  The game was one of the best side scrolling adventure titles on the original black and white Gameboy.  The password feature was simple with 4 characters instead of 12 or 16 like the Megaman games.  The ending was very well done and you definitely feel like you accomplished something finishing the game.

Apart from Batman my other love has been and always will be Disney. When I heard about the meeting of Mickey and Mario together in the form of a new white 3DSXL, I was determined to get my hands on it. This system was picked up in Nintendo World In NYC, and is only available for sale via Walmart and its website (And third party sellers on Amazon)

I was originally worried the design would look too ""girly"" for my taste as even though the system is for my eyes only, I didn't want to go around with such an eye catching system if I looked weird using it. Upon opening the box I was pleasantly surprised at both the cleanliness of the paint job as well as the fantastic yet simple gold and white design scheme upon the system. My only wish is since this didn't include the game it technically didn't have to have the games logo on it. My thoughts are ""What if the game sucks?"" now I would have a system that has the name of a crappy game on it. Where as if it was just Disney Oriented without the games logo on it, it could be just an excellent standalone Disney 3DS

If you love Disney and Nintendo and want a unique special edition 3DSXL I highly recommend this one!! Zelda fans have one, Mario fans have one, Yoshi fans have one, and now, FINALLY, Disney fans have one!!!",Disney Meets Nintendo,1397433600,22,,

5.0,False,"07 17, 2010",A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B001PTN5ZW,GreatMovieCriticForever,"It's not uncommon to have a video game that is better than the movie version adaptation of its characters.  The X-Men Origins Wolverine movie from last year was a pretty horrible movie. It made a ton of money because it's an action packed blockbuster, however, it sacrificed and a made a joke of so many comic book characters like the Blob and Deadpool that comic fans were left speechless. The movie was another dark spot for the X-Men franchise which hasn't gotten better since X-2. When I picked up this game, I expected the game to be utter crap, but I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it.

It's definitely geared for a R rated audience and doesn't treat the characters bad as the movie did. It has a big more of a background for the X-Men universe (though beating a Wolverine game you still didn't get much info for the supporting cast)

Pros:

Graphics and Video:

Graphics are stellar, smooth, gorgeous, and very detailed. Every character looks larger than life from Wolverine, to Gambit, to the Sentinels,  Victor Creed, Weapon X, and a host of other villains.

Characters:

A lot more characters are introduced that the movie. The movie introduced several characters but it introduced in such a banal way that you really didn't care what happened to them. Here at least the characters from the movie get more time to expand. Better yet is the fact that most of them look menacing and aren't made to look like jokes like the movie did.  We also more detail into the experiments that Stryker has done to mutants. In the movie, it's thrown together at the last second but really leaves you with nothing. We also delve into the covert missions that Team X has done, a lot more that's actually shown in the movie. Again in the movie, not much time is devoted to that, but in the game this is expanded a lot more.  We also see the creation of the Sentinels and see how Senator Kelly fits into all of this. A lot of the highlights in the game come from fighting the Sentinel machine. Top notch stuff and again the Sentinel makes no appearance whatsoever in the movie. Everything is so glossed over in the movie it's not even funny.

Comic book references:

The game is loaded with references and quotations from the X-Men comics, and X-Men movie franchise. Not a lot but that sole attempt at trying to give you a comic book feel elevated the game. Controls:

Activision, Raven Software made the controls as easy as possible. Wolverine has a lot of super moves and combo moves. You sometimes have to upgrade him to take advantage of them. I liked that they went all out and really tried to make Wolverine as complete as possible. For instance, you can actually regenerate when you are hit just like in the comic books.  The programmers added a lot of cool battle scenes and tricks that make this game a mind blow experiences. You might be fighting on the top of skyscraper, or taking apart a helicopter and it's crew in mid-flight, other times you might be taken on Weapon X itself.

Sound: Sound was equally amazing. Video games I tell you have really changed in the last twenty years and that's not even talking about Pc games. The video and sound you can get out these games nowadays is amazing. Anyways, sound was excellent everything from the fights and grunts of battle are heard. The voice recordings are great too. Hugh Jackman and LIev Schreiber reprise their roles from the movie for this. The supporting voices are decent too. You don't even notice the cast switches here because the videos voices are that professional.

Overall: Great

This is a great attempt at bringing the Wolverine story to life. In my opinion, does it ten times better than the horrible movie that while entertaining completely glossed and destroyed the characters that it was trying to replicate This game has it all. I liked that they didn't gloss over a lot of areas and better added a lot of news like the experiments with the mutants, addition of Senator Kelly. the creation, and fight with Sentinel.

The official Pc requirements say more or less to have:

PIV 3000, 1GB RAM, 8GB HDD, 256MB video card. However, as most Pc games more, you'll probably want to have more than what the official requirements say to get a really pleasant gaming experience. I ran this on Windows XP with an Intel Celeron Cpu with Cpu speed of 2.00 gigahertz, 1 gigabyte of Ram and really important here an NVidia Geforce 7900 Gs.

I don't review a lot of games but I can already tell this one warrants a review. I'm only halfway through, but this game rocks. If you are seeking a Destiny-derivative, multiplayer-munching, Call of Duty doping, trigger-happy, clone --- then turn away from the screen because this one isn't for you. It's actually refreshing and exciting to play.

It feels both unique and familiar at the same time. It reminds me of my first encounters with many N64 games--like the gameplay just feels right, right off the bat. And there isn't a 25 minute hand-holding tutorial of interactive cutscenes to start off the ""action"". I'm not going to breakdown every single element or go into the story.... I will address some of the negatives that people have complained about.

First and foremost: the long loading times. Honestly, I haven't even noticed them being long. Maybe it's only certain copies or consoles? I have even counted. Between missions or fast-travel, the game loads in 15 seconds or less. These instances are few and far between so I'm not sure why everyone is complaining so much. Secondly, lack of storyline. The storyline is actually pretty good for what it is. It's no Mass Effect or the Last of Us, but a large part of the story is the world that we get to explore and the characters. Fourth: poor graphics? Really? The graphics are fine. They look great and they don't affect the gameplay so stop whining people. It's not all about graphics. Look at some of these photorealistic beautiful games that take 7 years to make and play like crap. No thank you. I'll take story and gameplay over that any day. Lastly, backtracking and revisiting areas: a lot of games are steering away from this, I guess but I don't really have a problem with it. It takes a lot of cues from games like DK64, Banjo 64 or Mario 64 where you need to collect cores to proceed and unlock doors. Which is a good thing to me.

I read some negative reviews on this game so I was on the fence, but the platforming elements and world looked fantastic, so I bought it anyways. For $32 with Amazon Prime, how could I not? I am so glad I did. I have been so bored with the latest batch of ""next-gen"" games. Every game is the same thing. Locate point on you rminimap, retrieve item, fight bad guy. Travel, traverse, fetch quest, power up, rinse repeat. I understand to a point that every game breaks down this way, but I think you know what I'm referring to. This generation has just been a slew of boring sandbox quests and repetive, shallow shooting with very few games peaking my interest or doing anything truly fun or creative. ReCore is a refreshing change of course, and I'm very glad the developers or publishers didn't seem to catch on to the fact that they have a game on their hands worth $60. It seems they've undervalued their own creation, which is sad.

All in all I rate this game an 8.8 out of 10. Since there are so many haters tipping the scale unjustly, and I can't rank that precisely, I'll round to 5 out of 5. Haha",If Jak 3 and Metroid Prime had a Banjo Baby!,1474243200,11,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

Now, any veteran of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo classic Mario games will feel that this game is at a much slower pace.  While there is plenty of jump and run action, this game has many RPG elements--lots of story, items, story, puzzles, oh and story.  The story itself is very strange, but if you stop to read it (instead of skipping to the action), it's actually quite amusing.  Also, you'll run into levels that leave you scratching your head until you remember to flip the world somewhere or wave the remote at some wall to find the way forward.  Though, this is not so bad in my opinion, because you get to play the game longer.

So, Super Paper Mario may feel somewhat like the classic Mario gameplay, but it has so much more added to it wrapped up in a funny story.  Definitely a must-own game for Mario fans who have managed to snap up a Wii.",Old School meets New School,1176422400,3,,
5.0,True,"02 1, 2013",A3TXQIOHXRCDFC,B0050SZE2G,Riyad Kalla,"Far Cry 1 was arcade-ish and fun. Far Cry 2 took the whole ""Realism"" thing to a fault and dropped you in a fairly unfun, static but beautiful world.

Far Cry 3 takes the beauty of #2, makes the world even more alive (animals, hunting, getting attacked by things, etc.) and brings back the simpler fun of #1 then ads an awesome story that Ubisoft has become so versed at on top of it and you end up with a hell of a fun/beautiful game to just enjoy your time in.

I am not the type to love finishing games on Hardcore and if I die/retry a level or event too many times, I'll just stop playing something because all it does is serve to piss me off while I am trying to relax. Far Cry 3 is NOT like this at all, but I was so worried it would be which is why I waited so long to pick it up.

Was really happy to see that Ubisoft did a good job focusing on the fun here.

Invisible war is a must have for any xbox owner out there. While looking at the screenshots you may think this game is just a first-person shooter, but you are way off. This game adapts to your playing style, and what you put in, you will get out. Invisible war like its brother, it is completly inovative where anything you can think of doing is in the game. Lets say you want to throw that garbage can at that guard, well you can. If you want to solve all your problems by shooting your way through you can, or if you want to get through all life's problems by finding a way to avoid bloodshed you can do that as well. With 5 different endings based on how you play the game, you can never get sick of starting over and playing through the game differently hoping to get a new ending. No one minds playing a game more then once when the visuals look this good. Everything looks like its real life counter-part, and light and shadow are awesome which can be used to your advantage or disadvantage. The game is action-packed all the way through, never a boring moment, and a story that will prevent you from playing any other games in your collection. Don't let the screenshots fool you this game is deep, with hundreds of NPCs, books to read, and secondary missions to achieve, you could find yourself playing two or three hours in a sitting without even realizing time went by.

I was unsure about S.R. 4 because of all the weird alien stuff, but I can say that this game is an absolute blast! The super powers are really awesome, flying and jumping around the city is exciting and yet it still has the Saints Row feel that you know & love. The graphics are defiantly improved over it's last-gen counterpart... it has been polished up and has better textures, reflective surfaces, lightning, FPS & resolution, superior draw distance and nice bright vivid special effects that simply couldn't be done before. All the DLC makes this deal was well worth the money, there are tons of new outfits and weapons in addition to extra missions. I have been playing it non-stop, while I have hardly touched the GTA5 remaster since it released. I find this game making me laugh around every corner and it has been a very enjoyable ride. There is online co-op too.

There have been countless game titles that have been available on both consoles, but in my experience I have found the frame rates and as a result the graphics to be slightly superior on the XBOX360 (even if it sounds like a plane taking off).

Infamous is the first game, in the genres I enjoy (sandbox, sports and third person action), which has affirmed my reasons for purchasing a PS3 as a video game console. This game is simply stunning from a visual perspective and should be high on the list of Game of Year candidates.

I won't get into the storyline too much, but basically you are a courier who delivers and opens a package that explodes. When you wake up the city is in ruins and you discover you now posses special electrical powers. As the game progresses you learn more about why this happened and other ways to take advantage of your new found abilities.

Here's what I like/dislike about the game.

=========
LIKES
=========
* Variety of missions is great in the game, including side missions. Although the goal in some of the missions is the same (e.g. Guard the Dogs) I feel like I've never really completed the same mission twice. The environment and character AI is different enough where I feel like it's a new experience.
* Ability to climb anything, which reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assassin-s-Creed/dp/B000P46NMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assassin's Creed</a>.
* Load times or lack thereof. The only time I've seen a loading screen is when you first start or resume a game. Other than that, I've seen no loading screens for missions, areas, etc. The fluidity is simply amazing.
* The environment in combination with your ability to scale almost anything creates an amazing visual display. When I climb some of the structures in the game and rotate the camera you really do get a sense of height, which is one of the first times I've experienced that in a game to this magnitude.
* The powers/abilities you have progress at an even pace throughout the game and they actual bring the story line together. At first glance you may think great I can shoot electricity, but what else. The creators of the game did a really great job taking electric-specific powers to another level. Gotta love sliding/grinding on an electric line and then use the electric hover ability to gradually land onto another building. Amazing!
* Great storyline. The story unfolds like a great mystery novel. You know just as much as your character and new twists are always right around the corner.
* Incremental save points in missions. I hate playing a game where you get through a mission and you die very close to the end only to find out you have to start over again. I love how in this game you start off at the last milestone within the mission.
* Replay factor. With the ability to be both virtuous and evil, you can easily extend the life of the game. I won't ruin the story for you, but it's worth playing through both campaigns as your actions will impact the final storyline.

=========
DISLIKES
=========
* Targeting system. I just wish the game had an auto-locking targeting system to fight enemies, but this is really scraping the bottom the barrel, since I didn't enjoy the game any less.

So, in summary if you like open world/sandbox games and you enjoyed games like Assassin's Creed, this title is a must own. If you enjoy action games and especially third-party action games, this is also a ""no brainer.""

Pros:
1. The graphics: They are truly remarkable, but not exactly perfect. The game has some small hicups when its loading the next section, single player only.  These aren't very long at all, the longest I ever had was 8 seconds. (Most are 2 or 3)

2. The controls: The reviews here are frankly ... lies. The controls are not horrible and do not take long at all to get use to.

3. Single player campaign: Its longer than the usual campaign thats put into most games these days and for that it offers up a good replay value.

4. Online Multiplayer: It is incredibly deep, with a fantastic leveling and class system this will a last long time and is very rewarding.

5. DLC's: This game already has three out with each containing two maps which brings the total number of multiplayer maps to 14. (Hoping for more!!)

Cons:
1. Story: While it isn't even close to how bad people are saying, it could have been a bit better. COD4 had a good story that was fast paced and action packed.

2. Dialogue: It was as if the developers just threw random curse words just to move things along at times.

3. Characters: The characters are good but they lack real personality and are in all likely hood of becoming icons like Cole McGrath (inFAMOUS) and Sackboy (Little Big Planet).

4. Sound: I'm not complaining about the sound in the game, its fantastic.  My complaints lie with some of the voice work.  Sargeant Rico has some cool moments in the game, but they're brought down by unfinished work.

FINAL THOUGHTS
While I have my arguements about the game, it does more right than it does wrong. This game should be a standard for all future first person-shooters to come. Its campaign is packed with memorable moments throughout. It is the triple A title that was promised back in 2005, and I hope to see it become even better with future installments.",The great game we waited four years for!!,1250726400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

That genre is pixelated anomalies. FTL is a top-down, ship management strategy game in which you are the crew of a ship on a mission to save the Federation. Each level is a beacon, at which you can chose what to do from a few actions. Often, you will encounter an unfriendly ship, typically pirates or the rebels who seek to destroy your federation. You must manage your crew, power, and weapons system in strategic combat to overcome the enemy, or otherwise survive the encounter long enough to escape to the next beacon, all leading you to a final battle. Upgrading your ship along the way is a necessity, as the final battle will push you to the limit.

Multiple playthroughs unlock new ships like the Mantis Cruiser, a ship which relies more on boarding parties than cannons, to the Rock Cruiser which seeks to overcome enemies with brute force, to the Stealth Ship-- which has no shield system at first, but relies on a cloaking device for combat survival. If you love Star Trek style strategy, this smaller scale game will give you hours of entertainment.","and the best, game in the genre it defined",1426723200,,"{'Edition:': ' Steam', 'Platform:': ' PC Download'}",

Once again you're a small time band starting off in your garage - or make that, your back yard. As you play through songs on your guitar controller, your career begins to take off. You make videos, play larger arenas, and earn money. The money lets you buy yourself new outfits and guitars. As you battle special players, you unlock their characters - like Slash from Guns 'N Roses.

In every Guitar Hero game there have been songs I've liked and other songs I haven't liked. That's going to be true pretty much no matter who you are. They try their very best to provide a wide range of music to suit all guitar tastes, and they do an excellent job at it. Some of the songs are SUPER in this set and got me up off the couch dancing around while I played along.

The new battle mode is a ton of fun. Before, you'd get a simple encore at the end of each set. This time you occasionally have to fight a newcomer for guitar supremacy. In battle mode you earn ""attacks"" that you can then lob at your opponent. These do things like break strings, make you play double notes, make your screen shake, and much more. It is super fun. Near the end of the game when you're down in ""Hades"", you have to battle the devil himself playing ... Devil went down to Georgia!

There are of course the extras to unlock by doing things like playing 100 notes in a row, the ability to play against friends head to head locally, plus the new ability to play against others online! Talk about a true challenge! It was always scary enough looking at XBox Live and seeing how amazingly high some of those scores were. Imagine trying to play those people live?

The graphics are great. Each location is fleshed out in fantastic detail, from the flickering flames of Hades to the glowing red lanterns of your back yard. The audience always seems a little robotic, but heck, how much do you want from a guitar game?

Many of the songs are now original band-sung songs - including a Living Color song that the band re-recorded specifically for this game! There are still a collection of songs that are ""in the style of"" - some are good, some are really not so good. The Stevie Ray Vaughn song stands out as the not-so-good reproduction. Still, what can you do. Why aren't those bands giving the Guitar Hero guys permission to use their real tracks? Don't they know how immensely popular this game is?

We do have the wireless guitar controller and it's worked pretty flawlessly so far. We've noticed a tiny amount of 'misses' with the red button, but that may be us getting used to it, we'll have to see.

Highly, highly recommended. It was so much fun that my boyfriend, a guitar player, would occasionally try to play the ""real notes"" rather than the Guitar Hero game notes. It really is absorbing!

Its an excellent game with a low learning curve and an easy interface. The combat is easy but not wholly intuitive though some notions i.e.  using ice on firey enemies or fire on icy enemies kind of speaks for itself. The graphics are par for a gb color title and whereas DW3 for NES ends with the defeat of the Zoma this version offers some challenging after game content in the form of a bonus dungeon thats worth pursuing. The beginning of the game has a brief 'q and a' followed by a morality test that's used to determine  your level-up stats. Not essential or really entertaining but harmless enough.

The fear is more derived from your own mind than it is from the game itself. At first, I was hiding for almost five minutes straight at the slightest movement or sound. It made for an excellent experience however I wasn't getting anywhere in the game. You have to go into the game with the thought of it being just a game somewhere in the forefront of your mind. ""If you die, so what? It's just a game."" Unfortunately, this takes away from the very experience the game tries to draw you into. If you can find a balance between remembering that this is a game but still be into it enough to crap your pants every now and again, you'll find the progression to be enjoyable.

Now, with all of the above said and done, is it a good game?

For the most part, yes. The game does an excellent job at being a psychological thriller. Your character's movements are sluggish and the environment around you changes to reflect your sanity level. Cockroaches will appear at your feet, for example, when you're starting to lose it.

A lot of the old greats are here, and even though several of the better ones are missing (Roddy Piper, Lex Lugar, Sting, Ric Flair, Andre the Giant, etc), you can create them with the Create-A-Legend feature!  This is the thing that sold me on this game more than any other.  It's detailed enough to work, yet not so detailed that you have to spend hours figuring out how the thing works.  You can create just about any wrestler from scratch in less than 10 minutes once you get comfortable with it, then create the dream matches we never got to see in the 80's.  Remember the WWF vs. NWA vs. AWA rivalry?  Well, pit Rick Martel against Hulk Hogan, create Ric Flair (the CAW's are all over the internet) and throw them all into the ring at once in a 3-way dance to settle who truly was the best world champion of the 80's!  One feature I love is that you can become the referee in the match, so set up any match you want with yourself as the referee and then sit back and watch the fun.  The match won't end until you count someone out or end it on a submission hold, so make it last as long as you want to.  Here's just a few of the dream matches I've created: Steve Austin vs. Roddy Piper, Sting and the Ultimate Warrior vs. the Road Warriors, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic vs. Hulk Hogan (ok, that match was just for fun and really didn't last long, but it just proves you really can create just about anybody!).  Even if you don't create any wrestlers, the choices here are great for the 80's fan.  LOW2 is supposed to come out in the fall and offer more choices of match types (only 5 are supported here) and more fluid wrestler movements - and more wrestlers!  Until it arrives though, pick this one up!  One request to the developers, how about making sure we can use the legends we created in LOW1 in LOW2, ok?

This isn't the case with this program. I've managed to let myself get into terrible shape over the years, so I picked up this program after seeing some positive reviews.

The exercises are challenging, but not impossible -- even if you haven't worked out in a decade or more, they are definitely doable. What's better is that you don't feel defeated after doing a circuit, instead it gently lures you in to do more. This is the first program that I haven't shelved after a week. I am really enjoying it and slowly starting to see improvements, particularly in cardio (something I could not imagine myself ever saying).

The trainer asks you after each exercise if you found it too easy or too hard and adjusts the program accordingly. The best part is that you can do it in the privacy of your home, so no embarrassment about answering truthfully, which ultimately helps you reach your goals.

It comes with just the software, and asks what extra equipment you have at home, like weights, a step board or a yoga ball. The software will then incorporate those items into your workout. You can customize your workouts to focus problem areas, do yoga to relax, or just set goals.

And speaking of honesty, it's best to do all your measurements and weight as honestly as possible to get the max benefit from this nifty program. There's no point saying you're more fit than you are if it sets the system up to be more difficult when you first start out. The software also grows with you and changes as your fitness levels rise.

Here's to a new, fit, you, on your own terms. Highly recommend this program, I love it.",Finally! A workout I can do!,1407542400,2,,

I haven't touched a lot of these games for almost 20 years -- with the exception of the Sonic The Hedgehog series.  This console was the answer to the Super NES and almost had as much life as the former console.  But don't get me wrong -- Sega STILL produced a lot of timeless classics, and it's really hard for me to put down.  The plug-ins are very easy too -- all you need is the AC adaptor and AV cable; just make sure to switch your television to ""input"" mode in order to make the Sega Genesis work.

Now, I will recommend the following titles to the gamers who are already familiar with the Sega franchise or need something fresh to play.

Phantasy Star 1, 2, 3 & 4

Castlevania:  Bloodlines
Aladdin

There is one more game that I used to play when they had the Sega Channel out back in 1994-1996 (this was a monthly subscriber channel where you could select a different crop of games every month).  It's called Mega Man:  The Wily Wars.  This is the equivalent of Super Mario All-Stars; i.e. Mega Man 1, 2, and 3 were completely redesigned with new graphics, sound, and animation.  Sadly, you cannot get this title in cartridge format, and you would be lucky if you could even find it on the Wii/Wii U Channel.  The only other way to get it is to order the AtGames Sega Handheld Portable Console (with some built-in games) on Amazon's website.

5.0,True,"11 18, 2013",A2KKXOPP3F46IC,B00DE2W4PK,Joshua,"The best feature about the PS4 is how fast and incredibly accessible it is. For starters, it took me about ten minutes to connect it to my TV, download the day one patch and install a game (Killzone) before I was playing.

Here are a few things I found after a weekend of using the PS4:

1. The IU is fast. Downloading a game from the store, getting in and out of apps and using the Share button is very quick. I know the few seconds it took to open things on the PS3 wasn't a big deal, but you'll definitely notice the raw processing power of the PS4 by just navigating through the menus.

2. The games look better, but also play flawlessly thanks to the Dualshock 4 controller. It's more comfortable, has a much improved texture over the Dualshock 3 and those extra features -- lighted sensor bar, touchpad and speaker -- add just enough extras to make it feel more like a separate device, instead of just a controller.

3. You're going to need an internet connection to really enjoy the PS4. Yes, you can play it without one. But the whole system revolves around constant updates like shared videos and screenshots, game patches and community activity, and of course the ability to download any retail game in the PlayStation Store.

This doesn't mean that you actually have to be social on the PS4, but the system has some great abilities to tempt you out of your shell.

4. The PS4 does make some noise. I'd say around 90% of the time it hums along without a sound. The other 10% varies from a slight increase in decibels to a flat out roar. I noticed it got much louder when the system was running a game from a disc, whereas a game that was downloaded onto the hard-drive ran much quieter.

However, it gets nowhere close to overheating. In fact, I worry much more about my PS3 slim than the PS4.

5. The launch line-up is stronger than you think. If you're like me and waited to get AC Black Flag, NBA 2K14, Call of Duty or Battlefield 4 then you won't be disappointed with the wait. Visual upgrades are all you're getting, but these are NEW, highly rated games that you can play Day One.

Knack is more geared for gamers looking for a challenge, not kids. It reminds me of Mega Man where the artstyle will appear to kids but the game plays much older. And Killzone's online Warzone will keep you busy for days.

6. Remote Play is great. It works so much better than the horrible PS3-to-Vita connection. I didn't test the distance, but it worked great around the house and outside on the deck.

I purchased AC Black Flag, Killzone, Knack and Lego Marvel. All new games that I get to enjoy Day One.

Conclusion: There are a ton of other bits of information that I could get into about the PS4, but just know that if you liked the PS1, PS2 or PS3 then the PS4 will seem very familiar to you. If you're looking to wait for a specific game to jump on the PS4, then by all means wait. Like any console launch the game selection is thin, but that will change over the next few months.

And to the small .04% of PS4 owners who are having trouble setting up their system, good luck and hopefully everything gets resolved! I own a Wii U and had similar issues on Day One so I know what it's like.",A Great Addition for PlayStation Nation,1384732800,,,

Luckily they not only delivered, but released a very competent version for all rhytym game lovers that own a Wii.

RB2 plays pretty much like the first one, and if you are familiar with it and/or Guitar Hero, you'll be right at home. The objective is to clear songs by correctly following the on-screen color commands which match those of your controller, which could be either drums, bass or guitar. The experience is supposed to mimic playing music in a band, and that's were the whole fun of ""playing rockstar"" lays. Not only that, but working together as a team is very important to make sure everyone makes it to the end. The 4th would be the vocalist, and gets to actually sing along, karaoke style. This makes Rock Band the ultimate party experience.

RB2 Wii is thankfully compatible with all Guitar Hero peripherals, but sadly no Rock Band peripherals are compatible with Guitar Hero. RB2 Wii also features online play, and a massive DLC store so that you can increase your music collection.

I played it about 4 years ago. Black Isle strikes again

with a fantastic game ...

You can only play one character (the nameless one) but he is

super cool. He NEVER dies! lol ... well he can but then he gets back up again and ready to fight again. So, you can't actually get killed for good in this game.

You can join up with several NPC's, one being a floating skull

named, Morte. He is very cool to have around and is very powerful in high levels. There is even a somewhat romance for

the main character ... she's got a tail (laughs) and she is very neat to have around.

The graphics are superb, the storyline is one of the best I've seen and the combat system I just loved. Very easy to use controls and has dungeon crawl galore.

It's been awhile since I actually played it, but if I remember right, you can play 3 different classes. A fighter, a thief or a mage. The fighter class is by far the best one to go with.

You basically start out in a dungeon, lying on a hospital table, and then are greeted by Morte who will help you get started with how the game works, your fighting, journal, etc. He will then join up with you and help you escape the place. There is much to do right from the beginning, trying to escape. I don't wanna give away too much, because it is a very awesome storyline.

I will add however, as the story unfolds your character finds out more about himself. Why is is there and what lies ahead for him. It's hard to explain, but I am sure you will love it.

Give it a try, you will not regret it.

Also has a nice modding community on sorcerers.net.

5.0,False,"07 31, 2017",A3DK9DG8NLVF6,B00GODZYNA,Bugson08,"Naughty Dog is one of the video game industrys best developers in my opinion. They are notable for their classic platformer games, Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter, and their cinematic trilogy Uncharted. More recently, they were known for their masterpiece of a game, The Last of Us. While not every game they make is amazing, I honestly believe that few developers have maintained such a high level of quality in their games for as long as they have. It is also very interesting to see how their games maturity levels have evolved. With Crash and the first Jak game, they were kid-friendly games meant for all ages, but the later Jak games and Uncharted were for more a teen/young adult audience (although almost any age can enjoy them). With The Last of Us, Naughty Dog released their first truly dark game and it is arguably their most popular game yet, both critically and commercially. With Uncharted 4, Naughty Dog has crafted one of the most beautiful, touching, and fun games I have ever had the pleasure of playing.

 Obviously, Im a pretty big fan of Naughty Dog, but I think that in order to understand where Im coming from with this review, I should mention what I think about their previous games, specifically the Uncharted series. When I first played Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, I thought (and still think) it was a solid third-person shooter with gorgeous (at the time) visuals and fun characters. Uncharted 2, however, was on a completely different level and is still, 8 years after its release, one of the best games I have ever played. The characters were written better, the visuals were even more impressive, the set pieces were huge, and the pacing was phenomenal, meaning you were almost never bored when playing. While Uncharted 3 didn't have that same leap as from the first to second game, it was still a great game in my eyes and probably my second favorite of the trilogy, even if the pacing was a little off in the first half of the game. So, with that out of the way, lets get on to the meat of the review, starting with the gameplay.

 Despite what Ive heard from many people, mostly those who haven't played the games, the Uncharted series has always had changes to its gameplay with each entry. Not all of them are great or noticeable at first, but when you play the games back-to-back, you begin to appreciate the subtleties a lot more. With this game, one of the biggest additions to the game is the rope. By simply holding the L1 button, Nathan will start swinging his rope around and if there are any spots to grapple, releasing the button will allow him to hook onto it. It is a very simple and intuitive mechanic, allowing for not only Tarzan-like movements, but also some very cool takedowns on enemies; try getting into a gunfight, running away, jumping off of a ledge, grappling midair, and then jumping again off of the rope to land a fist in your enemies face. Moments like those are what make the rope so satisfying and it was one of the best additions to the gameplay.

 Speaking of taking out your enemies, the melee system is also the best in the entire series, taking the best parts from Uncharted 3 and removing the worst. For example, one of my favorite additions to the third games combat was having Nathan automatically take an enemys weapon from them if you had none, which returns here. On the other hand, my least favorite addition was the grab move, as it made combat needlessly frustrating since rolling and grabbing were the same button (leading to way too many deaths for this player). So, what did they do? They removed the ability to grab, which is fine by me. Usually, going in for a melee kill will require you to just mash the square button, but every once in a while, youll have to perform a counter move with the triangle button, which is very easy to do, but it is cool to see the different animations during the game, especially when they are Naughty Dog quality. In addition to the combat being improved, the gunplay has also been changed for the better.

 The best part, hands down, is the ability to pick up ammo with the triangle button and the ability to pick up weapons by holding down the same button. This means that you can walk across the battlefield while tapping triangle and not have to worry about accidentally picking up a gun you don't like, like in previous games. I don't see why you cant just automatically pick up ammo, but it is still a welcome change. This is especially helpful because this games combat has a lot more emphasis on mobility. With the previous Uncharted games, you usually just wanted to stay in cover and shoot your enemies, but with this game, almost all cover is destructible and since you cant throw back grenades (which doesnt hurt the gameplay at all), you always need to be moving. With the quick melee kills and fun rope swinging, this new approach to combat works very well and makes for some of the most enjoyable fights in the entire series. But, I think my favorite part of the combat would have to be the greater emphasis on stealth.

 Make no mistake, the stealth in this game is no Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell, but it is fun and satisfying nonetheless. Like the previous games, you can automatically sneak around when you reach a new area and you can silently take out enemies using the square button, usually by pulling them off of ledges or sneaking behind them. This works just as well as it did before, but there are few new features that make it more satisfying. First, there are now locations for you to hide in, which is usually just tall grass or foilage. This works perfectly because you can still move around in it and they are conveniently located around, so it makes sneaking about much easier. Second, you can now mark enemies by aiming at them and clicking a button; doing this will put a small arrow above their head that will let you always know their location, which is not only very useful in stealth scenarios, but also in combat when you are trying to figure out how to flank enemies. Finally, your partners can help you by sometimes taking out enemies that are in the way  granted, this doesnt happen often, but I did notice it. Like The Last of Us, your allies cant be detected and although this might break the immersion for some players, I prefer this over the alternate methods of not having backup or having them able to get caught. Overall, Im very pleased with the combat improvements in the game, but the game also has more exploration to it.

 Although the series is called Uncharted, implying that you are exploring uncharted areas, the series is known for being extremely linear, but Ive never had a problem with that in the series, as I think it helps the games maintain their high-quality. That being said, this game is a lot more open-ended. Instead of having levels featuring only one way to proceed, there are sometimes two or three ways of climbing somewhere, especially towards the latter half of the game. Again, the game is still linear, but compared to the other games, this game does have a different way of designing levels. Two of the 22 chapters actually feature levels that you can explore for quite a long time without progressing at all  one of these with a jeep in Madagascar and the other is with a boat out in the ocean. While I have always loved the linear levels, I think that these couple levels are a nice change of pace. As long as they don't take over the entire game, which they dont, Im OK with these. The only problem I have with these areas are the lack of good rewards for exploring  you usually only receive the silly treasures that have been a trademark in the series, but sometimes you get a better reward, which brings me to discussing the collectibles in the game.

 As I just mentioned, the treasures from previous games return, and they are as annoying as ever. Unlike Uncharted 3, they do give you points for collecting them (used to buy post-game rewards such as skins, weapons, render modes, and modifiers), so they can be useful, but they are just so boring to look for and collect, which is why I just use a guide for my second playthrough and never bother with them again. However, the game yet again takes inspiration from The Last of Us in providing artifacts to collect, this time being called journal entries; these pages provide some interesting backstory on the games events and make exploring worth it. I usually had fun exploring regardless of the rewards, but I enjoyed collecting the journal notes and entries far more than collecting the almost-meaningless treasures. Unfortunately, there are about twice as many treasures as there are journal entries and notes, so you won't always be receiving an intriguing note. There are also optional conversations  again, these are just like they were in The Last of Us, and I enjoy hearing these little side talks the characters have. These new types of collectibles are what makes this game achieve a 15-hour length, but I don't think that it is just padding; I enjoy exploring and learning about characters and their world, so it is time well spent.

 Before I dive into the story, I just want to quickly mention that in some pre-release footage, the game showed that you could make choices in the game during select conversations. These only appear three times in the story and are completely pointless, changing the story in no way and only affecting those three select lines in the game. Im guessing that Naughty Dog included these as a sort of test for themselves to see if they would ever be able to make a game with branching storylines, but it doesnt affect the game in any negative way here, so theres nothing to worry about. Just pick the lines you think are the best and move on with the game. Now, on to the story!

 One of the most notable aspects of this games story is that it is much darker and realistic than previous entries  the main menu starts with ambient noise and a video of a dead pirate in a cage, which is quite different from the triumphant menus of the previous games. Obviously, the game is still very unrealistic with its set pieces and Nate being a God at fighting an army, but it terms of characterization, this is different than the original games. Dont misunderstand me, the characters are still the same people weve grown to love, but there is something less fictional about them. I attribute this difference to the change of writers; Amy Hennig was the creative director/head writer for the previous games, while Neil Druckmann was the creative director/head writer for The Last of Us and this game. Different people have different tastes and although I love Hennigs superb writing in the previous games, I honestly prefer Druckmanns writing in these past two games. Having characters with more emotion and more realistic interactions makes me feel more emotionally involved with them. The game also has a slower pace, which allows for more character development. One of my favorite scenes has Nate sit down with his brother, Sam, and just talk. This conversation is completely optional, but it adds so much to both of their characters and something like that wouldve never happened with Hennig as a writer. Im not trying to criticize her, as she is still one of my favorite writers, but I do prefer Druckmann.

 I did mention that the game is slower paced and for the most part, this works in the games favor. The beginning chapters are particularly slow, but I think chapter four more than makes up for it  it is just a short chapter that shows what a normal life is for Nate and Elena, and it is this exact realism that allows for some of the best dialogue in the entire series. However, there were a couple times throughout the game where the slow pacing worked against the game, most notably during the two Scotland chapters. These areas weren't bad chapters, but after being roughly one-third of the way through the game, it was just getting to be a little much. Thankfully, I think the pacing gets back on track once you get out of there. As Ive mentioned before, the pacing is still slower than the previous games, but the greater emphasis on the story and characters make it worth it in my opinion.

 So, now Im just going to mention a few tidbits about the story that I like, but I don't want to go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil anything. First, I mentioned that the journal entries allow for some great backstory to be inserted into the game, and I know this has been said in many other reviews, but it is amazing at how Uncharted 4 not only has a great main narrative, but also a great subplot with Henry Avery and the pirates. You don't need to collect journal entries to understand it, as it is addressed in the main game, but collecting it adds so much more depth and makes you feel like you, not Nathan Drake, are actually uncovering history - I love it. Second, Rafe Adler is, by far, the best villain in the series  you love to hate him. He can be charismatic and suave one minute, but the next minute, he is flipping out on you and going into a psychotic rant. Most of the villains in the series were clichs; well clichs with fun performances, but clichs nonetheless. While Rafe does have some tropes, such as being a spoiled rich boy, the game makes him remarkably three-dimensional and he is just one of the best written characters in the series  he steals every scene he is in and for my first playthrough, I was always one the edge of my seat when he appeared, wondering what he would do next. The only thing that I will say about the story is that, just like the other games, there are probably some plot holes or inconsistencies, but if you don't overthink it, youll still be sucked in and love it.

 The last thing that I want to mention about the story is the ending. I won't spoil it, but I will mention that when I first beat the game, I was very conflicted on how I felt about it. However, after beating the ending a second time, I realized how much I appreciated the way Naughty Dog ended the series  it was a really fitting end for the series. So, even if you don't appreciate it your first time through, you will most likely grow to like it as time passes by.

 Another quick tidbit that I want to mention is the music. My God, the music! A lot of people were worried when Greg Edmonson, the composer for the original trilogy, wasn't returning for this game, but I can safely say that Henry Jackman fills his shoes nicely. I won't say that he is better, because music is probably the most subjective art form, but I definitely loved his score in this game and found him to be a suitable replacement. Again, this is probably just me, but Im confident that most people would like this score. The tracks For Better or Worse (played in chapter 17, which has the same name) and The Twelve Towers (played during many combat encounters in the game) are particularly noteworthy. Bravo, Mr. Jackman, bravo!

 Before I conclude, I must again mention something that I think is very important: chapters 17 through 20 and the final chapter (22) are some of the best batch of levels in any game Ive ever played. Without spoiling anything, Im just going to say that chapter 17 has the best character interactions in the series and it rivals what was done in The Last of Us (which is kind of a big deal); chapter 18 has the best scene in the series and one of the best in gaming in general (this scene involves a dining table and youll probably know it when you see it); chapter 19 has the best creepy atmosphere since the Spaniard levels in the original game; and chapter 20 has probably the best gunfights in the series. These are all amazing feats and the game ends with the best boss battle in the series (not that that is saying much, but it is fun). Because Uncharted is so focused on story and characters, it is very difficult to describe why these parts of the game are so great, but if youve ever wanted a story that has the realistic writing of The Last of Us with the gameplay of Uncharted, this game is it. If youve played the three main games, you owe it to yourself to finish the series off with the best game in the series  I put it on equal grounds with the second game (Uncharted 2 has better pacing, but this game has a better story to make up for it).

I was a huge fan of Super Mario 64 when it first came out for the Nintendo 64 - the graphics and gameplay were amazingly good. It's been many years since then, but the Super Mario 64 DS version brings that same level of graphics and fun gameplay to the portable DS system.

The dual screen really shines here - you can easily keep track of your map and objective on the lower screen while running around on the top screen. The graphics and sounds are classic, being just as fresh and fun now as they were during the initial release.

Even better, the game has built in VS mode which you can play with other DS owners who don't even own the game! They download a quick applet, and instantly can run around various boards with you, seeking stars and tracking down specials.

There are additional levels and minigames in this version of Super Mario 64 which are just as much fun as the main game. You can really get absorbed in this for many, many hours, and with the wireless VS, it's fun both alone and with others.

5.0,False,"07 19, 2015",AJXDBMJBVUGSR,B00YY3OK0A,S. H. Wells,"These are probably the best wired headphones available for the Xbox One with added bonus that the boom microphone tucks away inside the ear piece so you can use the headphones while listening to music at home or on the plane. In terms of functionality, comfort, and sound quality these headphones are easy to recommend to anyone looking for a good pair of gaming headphones.

Functionally, these headphones offer a solid gaming experience and are easily versatile enough to become the ""go to"" headphones for a variety of listening situations.  If you are looking for a multipurpose headphone that will also work with the Xbox One, then the X300 is the way to go. The X300 is a good choice for Xbox One users, but if the Xbox One is the sole reason for purchasing headphones, your money will go farther with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ear-Force-Stealth-420X/dp/B00YXO5X4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ear Force Stealth 420X</a>&nbsp;.  The telescoping mic is a brilliant touch that keeps the mic handy when you need it, but allows these headphones to be perfect companions while travelling.

The intended use for these X300 is the Xbox One, and the arrived smartly packaged in an Xbox branded box.  The X300 comes with an adapter that is slightly smaller than the standalone&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xbox-One-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/dp/B00IAVDOS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter</a>.  However just like the standalone adapter, the X300 offers channel volume control so you can adjust game volume independently of chat volume. The mic mute and headphone mute buttons are also conveniently located on the adapter. There is also a mic mute toggle located on the earpiece as well.

Friends noted that my chat voice was clear and easy to understand, although slightly less crisp than Turtle Beach's 420X. However since the X300's are hardwired to the controller, there was none of the lost signal that can (and does) occur with the 420X's.

Finally in terms of functionality, sometimes simplicity is best, and the case of local multiplayer games the X300 holds an advantage.  The X300 headphones plug into a controller and whoever is using the controller also uses the headphones. The wireless 420X's have an annoying problem of being ""assigned"" to a user that has signed in.  If multiple people are gaming together on one console, using the settings app to correctly assign the 420X is time consuming.  For couch coop sessions, the X300 and other wired headphones for guests is hands down the way to go.

These headphones have an ingenious headband system that basically allows the band to melt onto the users heads providing an unbelievably comfortable experience.  I wear glasses, and I struggle with ""too tight"" headphones because they apply too much pressure to my ears.  But too loose and the headphones will slide all over the place. I had my doubts about headphones that did not have a traditionally adjustable band.

Happily, I can report that this headband system is among the most comfortable and is absolutely the easiest to wear that I've ever experienced.  The inner band has very slight resistance as it expands to hit the wearer's head. On each side of the of the inner band are two retracting wires that provide the tension for the inner band. The four wires seem to be independent which allows the inner band to adjust to basically any sized head.  The rigid outer bands provide the squeeze that keeps the earpieces in place.  The weight of the outer band and earpieces is removed from the inner band by this ingenious halo system.  It feels as if almost nothing is resting on my head while the earpieces fit snugly.

The headband system coupled with the soft leather-like earpieces combine for a very comfortable headphone experience.

Finally no matter how comfortable or functional headphones are, sound is the most important quality.  The X300's provide deep bass as well as distinct highs.  The earpieces are designed well enough to significantly muffle exterior noise, while the speakers have enough volume to really allow you to exist ""in"" the game.  During a session of The Elder Scrolls Online the X300s really had a chance to shine: I could hear the distinct sound of nirnroot even while I was pretty far away. I had a foraging advantage with my headphones over relying on the TV's speakers.

The X300 provides a full set of features that gamers need while also offering quality sound and an unbelievably comfortable experience. The fact that users never lose the signal and they don't have to lose a USB port on the Xbox makes the X300 a strong contender against Turtle Beach's 420X. If you play lots of local coop games, or if you want to bring your headphones into other situations the X300s have a distinct advantage.",One of the Best Options for Wired Headphones,1437264000,3,,

The included book is a high quality hardcover filled with beautiful artwork of Tekken fighters in various stages of creation. Fans will love it, others will throw it aside and want to know where the game is... and some will put it in the closet as a collectible.

Their concerns are totally unjustified, yet the vocal minority still gets the most attention.  Upon installing Origin, as with any game marketplace (Steam, GFWL), you accept the terms of a standard EULA, this one limited and governed by EA's very strict Privacy Policy.  Also, don't believe those who criticize Battlelog as cumbersome, it's had several revisions since day one, and makes ""social gaming"" a reality.  Joining matches is fast, the filter is easy to use, and has just been revised to help find the exact match you desire.

This is supposed to be a game review, but there are more than enough written by people who haven't even played the game.  I'm not going to tell you why it's so great.  I like it, but I've also enjoyed BF1942, BF: Vietnam, BF2, BF2142, and BFBC2.

You can listen to the 200 or so MW3 fans and Steam supporters (who place value on platform over product).  They know what they want to do, they want to give the game 1 star because of some loyalty or ideal they think justifies bashing and trashing a game that they've never played.  Basically,  some people like it, and the haters don't, they crusade against it.  It's pathetic and sad.

There are over 500,000 people playing BF3 on PC, and 200 people came here to give it one star. That's not a statistically relevant result by any means.  It's less than a tenth of a percent, more people than that hate broccoli.  Most people who bought it are too busy playing to write reviews (except me, I'm too buzzed to step foot on the Battlefield).  Anyway, myself and most of my friends have already logged in well over 24 hours of play and we won't be stopping anytime soon.

Here's the review part. I'll keep it short.

Campaign: Beautiful, challenging, somewhat generic, AI is aimbot-like in their deadliness. Overall though, I found this to be a 4 star experience (the jet portion is a particularly unforgettable experience, seriously, it's amazing).

Multiplayer:  There's nothing as good as this out here, NOTHING. The weapons the vehicles, they all work beautifully.  Hit registration is amazing, with bullet drop and the ability to change firing modes, I've never been so immersed as when I play this game.  It's a new BF3, DICE has innovated and changed the BF series for the better. The gameplay is phenomenal, the graphics are amazing.  The maps, well I like 6 of 9 pf them, and there's 4 more on the way for me, thanks to my pre-order.

I am 100% glad I bought it, and sad to see that the trolls are as predictable and PATHETIC as ever.

As for Battlelog, it's basically like the Facebook of BF3. Tons of stats and ways to connect with people.  I've never had so many people to play with.",Don't listen to haters,1320451200,3,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC Download'}",

I was expecting the game to be more of an expansion game to Pokemon White, instead of a full-blown, full-content Pokemon game. The game plays out extremely well, with a few added graphics enhancements to Pokemon White. The number of Pokemon is overwhelming in the game, as well as the number of areas and cities to explore. The story line is also cool, it picks up 2 years after the events of Pokemon White, so you get to see a lot of the old characters return.

From then until now, the best overall fighting game I've played is  Fight Night Champion. Fight Night 4 was good but this one is really great. The physics in the game are so realistic and fun, that you can literally just box like a real boxer would and you'll win that way. If you just try to spam and button mash you will get knocked out by any decent player. Thats another great thing about it, and it's because you can counter punch, or power punch, and like in real life those punches hurt a lot more than getting jabbed while you're backing up or something similar. Not only is this a great fighting game, but it's one of the best games I've ever played as far as fun factor. It's in my top 5 most fun games ever. I bought it when it was released and I play several days a week. I'll be playing it until they make another one. Also, the physics in this game are so groundbreaking that it has more potential than any other fight game. If they made a mortal kombat or street fighter type game with physics like this game has it would be unreal. The game also has very realistic graphics. The boxers almost look like you're watching TV.

Anyone who uses a PS4 regularly knows the need for wireless charging, it's just something you have to have.
Regardless of that however, the PS4 controllers don't last as well as their PS3 cousins, especially for long periods of game play in Mordor, or Assassins Creed for example.

Moving along the lines of the great N64 game GoldenEye, Perfect Dark has made what GoldenEye a success and added on to it to create a great game, with much help with the Expansion Pak.  For me, without a doubt, the best one-person level has to be the first one.  Where else can you go through a office building shooting practically everyone you see?  The music and the tone of the level reminds a person of the Terminator movies.  The other great level has to be Chicago-Stealth.  This is another great level that the music and dark tone (which is hypened by the rain) makes a great level that you'd wish the developers had made into a multiplayer level.  The other levels are not as good as these two, but are still great in their own ways.  The sound of the game is another highlight.  I love listening to the bad guys yell ""I've been shot!"", ""Is that a bullet"", ""Holy-"", among others.  These are just classics.  The multiplayer of Perfect Dark is good and bad at the same time.  The good is that you can play with bots.  The bad is that you can play with bots.  Unfortunately, the developers haven't given the player the best multiplayer levels.  The first level on the game itself (inside the Datadyne office tower) would have been excellent.

I expected nothing less from Nintendo than this refreshing change from all the Extra-Juicy Director's Editions of Grand-Theft-Whatever: Blow Them All to Pieces.

More than just that, it's a good choice for parents, also.  I bought this game for myself, but Mom probably plays it more than I do.  The game is sort of a G-rated ""Second Life"" with animal characters.  One of the key selling points on the game is the ability it gives players to interact with other gamers online, but the game is perfectly functional even without playing this way (I have never even used the online feature of this game, and I feel no compulsion to do so).  For those who do like to play online, I would recommend buying the bundle which includes the microphone so you can chat with other players.  You do not need to have the microphone to play the game, so if you don't plan to use the online feature, just go the cheap route and buy the game by itself.

Although only one player can play at a time, the game will store up to four different scores (all of which live in the same environment - so they are separate, but still connected).

I read a bunch of reviews of this game prior to purchasing..actually because of the mixed reviews I ended up going with FEAR first, which I am greateful for.  Sometimes a game comes out and does ok and with further feedback and increased technologies, the next game in line is much better.  Some reviews about FEAR 2 would disagree with this principle.  I do agree it may have made for a better console game than a PC based game possibly due to some control configurations or the HUD...--a confessed slightly different feel--, but I did feel it was a lot of fun on the PC nonetheless.  I must say that FPS games are not my typical style.  I enjoy the RPG's and Strategies more so but was looking for something with some creepyness to it....After FEAR I played Perseus Mandate and then the expansion, Extraction Point, a bit backwards but worked fine nonetheless.  The graphics and playability in terms of challenges and how to overcome them I thought made for a very enthralling game....had me hooked from the start and the stuff with Alma and all the other wierd stuff just made it great!  It is a fairly easy, linear game to play, much like Max Payne, which I also love and play again and again but for me, FEAR 2 did not fall shaort as some would say.  I did not like the film grain feature and quickly turned that off but the graphics were just as good as the first set of games....details and environments along with music were very familiar and not overdone...the creepyness was still there and even intensified.  Other complaints were that the characters were not the same as before..not really sure what they mean or why that really matters as it is the style of game and familiarity of play structure to the previous games that mattered more to me.....in a sense, why would all the characters be the same when there was so much devistation caused by the end of Perseus Mandate..I believe the main character---you---was still the same........anyway, I thought FEAR 2 was well worth playing and can't wait to play FEAR 3...there is one last thing I will have to agree with...the leaning out to shoot, although I never used it seemed a bit frustrating that the enemies used it a lot but you could not....just had to hide better and use slow mo....oh, i also like the HUD better in the first FEAR as well as medkit use, but it all worked out fine.....and instead of gaining hit points so to speak, it was neat that you could gain slo mo time.....so, for what it is worth, that's my two cents...if you liked FEAR, the expansion, the standalone...well, I almost promise you, you will like FEAR 2...enjoy.",Great Game,1291852800,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Turned out to be a very good game with one or two little things you need to know. First, if you get the DVD version, it has to be activated on Steam. So if you don't have a Steam account, you'll need to get one, there are free. (This might be a killer if you don't have broadband though.) At any rate, the other thing isn't really loudly spelled out. You MUST HAVE a 64-bit edition of Windows to run this game. It won't run on 32-bit Windows at all. I didn't realize this until after I got it for my Win 8.1 64-bit system. It ran great on it and I decided to put it on my older gaming Win 7 32-bit system. The game downloads are around 26 gigs on 64-bit systems, and only 114 MBs downloaded on my Win 7 system and when I tried to start the game it bailed with ""No executable file found."" Turns out that the game won't even install on a 32-bit system, but doesn't warn you if you try. (The 114 MBs were the extra libraries needed to run the game with.) These are two things that might turn you off. That said, this game is a very good third person game based in Ancient Rome. I was really impressed by the play and the way they seemed to have worked out the use of weapons. I normally like a little time to ""get into the game's controls"" a bit before being ""throw into the action"" but it seems these days that's what they do. At any rate, I've played a short bit of this game and really enjoyed it. Graphics are very good even on my system which isn't a 4k system at all. (Game is supposed to be designed to play on a HD 4K system.) But even on it, this game plays great for me.

For years I wanted to buy it but kept skipping it for other games because I was always told it was just a copycat of Grand Theft Auto. Well, in a way it is, but in my opinion I actually enjoy this game MORE than Grand Theft Auto. If you've never played this before then just think that it's Grand Theft Auto but with less guns and more martial arts action. This game is simply FUN, and there's plenty of unique happenings during gameplay the GTA series just lacks, like action sequences while you're playing that come straight out of Bruce Lee movies and others such. I'll never forget the first time i was chasing down a guy, went leaping over a high wall after him only to watch myself go falling down several stories slow motion to where i went crashing down through a glass roof then on into the chase again. And there's a BUNCH of moments like that in this game. The story is interesting, but what i enjoy the most is that you can be a good guy and/or a bad guy (even though you're an undercover cop, you can be a bad guy if you want), AND i just love tearing through the streets kung-fu style doing flying dropkicks and spin-kicks and the like.

To sum it up, this game is Grand Theft Auto in China with less gun play and tons of martial arts fighting ala Batman: Arkham City style fighting. If you even remotely like any of that then you'll enjoy this game. WARNING: the cops in this game don't mess around though so you don't have 20 minute shoot-outs with them ... they will hunt you down and kill you right quick if you go around attacking them.

This isn't the first physical fitness game--Konami did it first with ""Dance Dance Revolution"" on the PS One. However, ""Wii Fit"" is superior to it by making the action much less based on competition and sweating 'till you drop.

It plays more like a physical fitness all-in-one video, with exercises for strength-building and aerobics. There's plenty of yoga positions and balance games. However, it excels as a physical fitness instructor for people who aren't typically health nuts. The balance board is necessary for people to find their true center of balance.

It seems a little silly and embarassing at first, but it's surprisingly enjoyable. Whereas DDR was solely about fast-paced foot-stepping and loud music, ""Wii Fit"" is all about keeping people comfortable while staying fit. With the cute, cartoon-like Miis exercising along with your movements, exercise is much more fun than you might expect.

Some of the games and exercises don't work as well as they should. I really couldn't figure out how to get a high school in the lotus game, in which the person must sit cross-legged on the balance board and remain as still as possible. Other exercises, such as the last Yoga poses, lack the interactivity of the balance board.

Still, the balance board is an excellent measuring stick for people to maintain a center of balance. The actual challenge is in maintaining the proper form--by keeping your balance so the red dot on the screen doesn't escape from the yellow area. It's like an optomotrist eye check, only without the eye strain. The colors on screen are light pastels against a white background, making everything easy on the eyes.

Wii Fit may not be the most groundbreaking, exciting game of the year, but it certainly is the most innovative and useful one. It's definitely worth the high price, and people will definitely want to upgrade to ""Wii Fit Plus"" if they enjoy the original.",Fitting title for fitness,1259452800,,,

After 1 year, friends decide to reunite up in a lonely ski lodge cabin, although many have clear reservations about the inappropriateness of the venue and the circumstances that befell them 1 year prior.  And that's about all the story spoiling that you'll get from me and the 8 characters who meet their fate at the hands of your own decision-making.

This game is a definite love letter to the 90's horror flick. It has a definite Scream meets Final Destination vibe to it with Butterfly Effect concepts shamelessly sprinkled into it. What makes it all the more intriguing is the ""butterfly effect"" story system. Seemingly innocuous choices--including an early choice to see who is calling your friend's cell phone when it's none of your business--affect the story further down the line. As a result, there is HUGE replay potential here. What would have happened if I left the cell phone alone? What happens if I decide to throw a snowball at a bird instead of my friend instead? A flutter of butterflies in the upper left-hand corner of the screen will briefly signal that you've made a choice that affects the story further down the line...you never know if the choice that you're making on the first playthrough is going to matter or not, but as soon as you make it, you'll know that you've chosen a fate, no matter ""how the hell does that affect anything"" may seem at the time. Add to that unusual 4th wall-breaking sessions with a doctor between ""scenes"" who asks questions about what makes you uneasy/anxious/scared and you have created an exotic mixture of ""what the hell is going to happen to me now?!?"" And there are bigger questions - the doctor is talking to you...but who are YOU??  It's somewhat surreal and even has you questioning why he's talking to you and why it even matters.  What's even MORE fun is the discovery of totems that are color-coded based on the type of event that they foretell and offer you a very brief glimpse of the future. All of these diverse elements do a great job in adding dread to the game. That, and there are clues scattered throughout the area that may/may not help you unravel the mystery of what's going on and may/may not help you save more lives literally UNTIL DAWN.  Maybe it matters...maybe it doesn't.  Maybe harming a small animal affects something.  You'll never know...until you try...and see the consequences of your various actions unfold.  Decisions also affect how people interact with you...and whether or not they'll be willing to help you later.  While the system feels obvious on the surface, how it ultimately unfolds is not unlike a Walking Dead experience as executed by TT Games.  It's fantastic fun and I can't wait to try alternative roads in the future.

If you liked Heavy Rain, you'll be in good company here....except that the game mechanics are not nearly as clunky and they feel like they make more sense. QTE moments help to ratchet up the tension and they don't feel cheap...when you're on the run, having good reflexes make sense and they don't cheapen the experience like Resident Evil 6 did, for example. So far, I'm giving it a 4.75/5. It's not perfect, but I'm dying to play it some more already...I've only scratched the surface; that alone warrants a full 5 stars for me. A game like this has been a loooong time in the making and I'm glad that it's here.

One additional note:  the score is exceptional on this film.  The song ""O Death"" will give you chills as the opening credits roll and sets the tone for the game early.  Voice acting is great and the game is very self-aware of its roots, and rolls around in its genre's playground willingly and with a great amount of fun I might add.

First, of course, the graphics. We play this on a 36"" TV and even on the big screen the graphics are incredibly sharp. The characters are realistic down to their hair styles and tattoos. The fields each have their own configurations - including the baseball diamonds on some. The lighting, player moves, reflections and more are incredible. You easily get the sense that you're playing a real game and controlling it.
The gameplay builds each year on what came before. So you can create your own team, go through the draft, play it through a season, and get the full satisfaction of getting through the superbowl (if you're good enough). You get to make decisions everywhere from the owner level down through the manager and actual player level.
If you're not into that level of detail, there are of course many ways to just ""play"". There are training levels to get you learning the basics. There are many training camp features that feature great graphic/gameplay combinations to really help you learn about blocking, throwing and more. Once you understand the game mechanics and keys, you can jump into a wide variety of games under all sorts of conditions to see how well you'd do.
Like any strategy game, this is NOT a game just to pick up and expect to do well in after 5 minutes. If you're looking for an ""easy arcade"" kind of game, you might do better elsewhere. The strength of this release is with its details. Once you get into the great complexity of really handling a team, you learn real life lessons that help you understand how actual football teams are managed and developed. You can almost consider this game a training system for people who really want to enter the NFL and work there. You learn a great deal about how plays are designed, how managers coordinate the team's efforts and how owners work to make the team the best it can be.
I found the 'background comments' far less annoying than in previous versions of Madden, but on the other hand the choice of music in the background wasn't the best. I'm a big fan of all varieties of music, but what they have playing just isn't enjoyable after the first listen or two. So it might be good to mute that and play your own stereo while you play.
In general I highly recommend this for any football fan.

There are many ways for u to get the jo  done, there are about 7 or 8 different stealth kills i think. And there are many combos that you can learn, and some that you can find on your own.

The bad guys don't suspect anything because its just a bird. You have many option of which to attack. One complaint of mine is that it takes too long to switch between your weapons. There is concept art between load times, and they are fun to look at and you may not be done by the time that it is done loading.

I purchased a set from Amazon knowing that if they were indeed a waste, Amazon's hassle-free return policy would keep me covered. Amazon shipped them quickly, and with my Prime subscription (so worth it!) they were on my doorstep in two days. Installation is as simple as clicking them onto the existing analog control sticks.

The difference was immediately noticeable; the extra height of the sticks is about 40%, which means... heck, it's Science:

""FPS Freek extends the length of your analog stick, increasing your range of motion, giving you 40% more linear distance from full stop to stop. This gives you more leverage and increased control without disturbing your natural gaming feel. FPS Freek will help you to aim and lock in on your target faster, while putting less strain on your finger.""

I figured that much extra range would take a lot of getting used to, but within half an hour I'd noticed moving and aiming felt ""slow"", so I went into the options menu and increased the sensitivity from medium to maximum in Gears of War 2, and where before it would feel jumpy/twitchy/less controlled with the increased sensitivity, with the FPS Freeks installed it felt natural to be moving and aiming that quickly. I definitely maneuver quicker and aim faster and more accurately now.

Although the gameplay is very similar, the style and atmosphere are completely different.  Rather than greek mythology you have gothic monsters and settings.  I'm personally enjoying this more so than I did ""God of War.""  I like the werewolves, vampires, and ghouls much more than I like medusas, cyclops, and cerebus.  Also, so far this game seems to be more difficult than the ""God of War"" series.  You really have to make use of that dodge button.  But as one reviewer already said, don't worry it's not nearly as difficult as ""Demon's Souls.""  I'll be updating this review once I finish the game.  But so far I will say that it's turning out to be a great game.  Easily as good (if not better)as god of war.

Oh yeah, and don't listen to those couple review websites who gave this game a 7.5 out of 10.  So far I'm saying this game deserves no less than an 8.8 out of 10, although by the time I'm finished I'm betting that I'll feel it deserves a 9.5 out of 10.  Yeah its gameplay is similar to god of war, but what game doesn't draw inspiration from other games?  Practially all FPS games are alike, but you don't here people crying and complaining every time a new one comes out... do you?  And practically all sandbox games are similar to the GTA series, but once again no one seems to care.  Castlevania is doing nothing different here.  They are using a winning formula (God of war) and improving on it.  Just like ""Halo"" used the exact same first person perspective from ""Doom"" but made improvements on it.  Bottom line is we can't expect every new game to reinvent the genre.  Ok enough of the preaching.  Anyways, so far I recommend this game to anyone looking for a gothic adventure.

****UPDATE:  I wanted to share more of my feelings about this game now that I've progressed a bit further.  I'm now beginning the 4th chapter (I know it's not that far, but I'm in college full-time and I'm busy with work).  This game has me hooked so far.  Amazing boss battles (and lots of them), great soudtrack, awesome action gameplay, it's all just great.  I've just finished the land of lycans (werewolves) and now I'm heading into the land of vampires... very excited!  This is one of the best games to come out for a while.  If you like action games and gothic themes then you owe it to yourself to pick this one up, it's amazing so far.  I will conclude this review once I finish the game (not sure when that will be since I'm so tied up with school, I hardly have time to play).

********Review Conclusion:  Ok I have just completely finished this game.  Castlevania LOS was a great experience all around.  I would personally rate this game a 9.2 out of 10.  It has a good blend of action, puzzle, and platformer.  There are tons of different monsters to fight in this game, extremely varied.  I don't think I've ever played a game with so many boss fights.  The music here is beautiful, and at times I stopped playing just to listen to it.  This game really does feel epic, and Gabriel Belmont is a character that I was rooting for the entire time.  Also, I wanted to remind you that if you play this game make sure that you wait for the credits to roll when you beat it.  After the credits are done rolling you get a good idea of what the sequel will be like (and it's going to be pretty crazy).

And with each game I have felt like the series is just getting better, until Battlefield 3 hit. It was a lot of fun, but the destruction seemed to be gone, and the recon class was nearly pointless. Now Battlefield 4 is upon us, and it is a titan to behold.

Graphics: 4/5
Seriously not sure what everyone is complaining about on this part of the game. It looks amazing, more organic than Battlefield 3 did. It has a few glitches here and there, but this has not impeded my gameplay at all. The water rolls and moves in a realistic way, buildings look incredible, individual players look amazing. Ran into a small problem with the knifing in a game, where it would jump a bit, however this could be attributed to lag as that games was the lagiest match I've ever been in.

Gameplay: 4/5
Seriously can't figure out why the join party option and the class changing options are gone from the main screen, otherwise it is absolutely amazing. Snipers can dope their scopes for certain ranges (200,300,400,500, 1000 meters). This is a HUGE upgrade, less guessing as to bullet drop. Not sure of a range on your target, look at a flag near them, set your scope to that distance, and boom easy hits. There are more options for your classes too. Want a sniper rifle with a bipod, scope, and rangefinder, well guess what it's possible. Want a gun with a scope on top, and iron sights on the side? Again it's possible. The weapon customization has skyrocketed in this game. Classes are much easier to set up as well. Each class has their own primary weapon type (Assualt=Assault Rifle Engineer=PDW Support=LMG Recon=Sniper Rifle), and every class has the ability to use Carbines, DMR's, and Shotguns. And instead of unlocking them in a certain order, you unlock the as you use them, like the carbines more than your sniper, well continued use of your carbine will only unlock carbines, your sniper rifles won't be unlocked, saving you time on each weapon set. There is literally too much to list on the amount of customization you can do. Controls are different in this game, but they feel more natural once you get used to them, and are set up more like real life for Helicopters and Jets.

Sound: 5/5
Absolutely spot on in sound quality. I have not yet experienced the sound loss when in a helicopter. I threw on my Turtle Beach Headset and cranked the volume all the way up and it sound exactly like I was at the shooting range. Bullets snap as they go buy your head, tanks can be heard from far off corners of the map, helicopters can be heard tearing off overhead, building creak and moan before they fall. Just perfect sound quality.

I have not experienced any server issues thus far. Every time I try to join a game, I'm in in seconds. Not problem with the server browser either, look for what I want and I get it. I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy, but this game just keeps getting better every time I turn it on. I had a serious issue with deciding between this and COD Ghosts, because both look so good this year, and I may even end up with both. I'm here to give my opinion of the game, and I have.

5.0,False,"04 20, 2006",A8TM0MI3D9T29,B000A1IMSG,Brett Corkins,"So you're looking for an NBA game but don't know which one to get? I shall sort through the good and bad offered in both NBA Live 2006 and NBA 2K6.

Between the two I have played (Live '06 and 2K6), I can honestly say NBA 2K6 was a better buy for me. At $20 I've had countless hours of some of the most joyous moments and some of the most frustrating. However, NBA 2K6 is more of an all-around basketball game. If you're good at offense and poor on defense chances are good that you won't win as many games as you might think. But if you're only good at defense and horrible at offense, you won't win much then either. You basically have to play an even game altogether (this is based on All-Star level).

For fans of offensive-minded games, look no further than NBA Live 2006. The basic controls are straight-forward and easy to get a hang of so there won't be any real problems for newcomers to the series (such as myself). The best aspect featured in Live '06 is undoubtedly the Freestyle Superstars. My favorite team is the 76ers and to see Allen Iverson pulling off the moves he does in real life on a game is nothing short of a rush. Another highlight is that when you're left wide open for a shot, chances are extremely good that you'll drain it. Whereas on 2K6, you still basically had to have a perfect release.

As for the overall look of each game, I'd say that NBA 2K6 steals that as well. When you're looking at Allen Iverson (or any other player for that matter) there's no question who you're looking at. He's got his tattoos, his cornrows, mustache, everything. NBA Live 2006, on the other hand, almost tends to look childish at times. Don't get me wrong, the graphics and dunks are awesome to look at, but as you're dribbling upcourt I can't help but think the player's arms are too long. Of course, that could just be me. 2K6 also seems to have more realistic courts (I could do without the shots of the fans though).

NBA 2K6 pros:

-Fantastic gameplay

-The more you play the more you learn, making it a game you can invest time in

-The graphics are great

-When you turn up the difficulty it ACTUALLY GETS HARDER

NBA 2K6 cons:

-Offseason on Legacy mode is kind of lame

-Too frustrating at times

-When the other team is on a run, it's nearly impossible to hit anything other than a lay-up

-Loading time is almost ridiculous

NBA Live 2006 pros:

-Easy for anyone to pick up and play

-Freestyle Superstars

-Commentary is a lot better than 2K6

-Dunks are fairly easy to execute and make for some excellent highlights

NBA Live 2006 cons:

-Camera angle is horrible

-Far too offensive-minded

-Almost too easy at times

-Fouls are called too liberally on you

So there you have it, a fairly unbiased view on each game. If Live '06 were to drop down to $20 I'd highly recommend it, because in reality, it really is fun to play. But at $30 I'm not sure if it's worth every penny. Plus, 2K6 has a great street ball mode in addition to the legacy mode, so did Live 06 ever really have a chance?",NBA Live 2006 vs. NBA 2K6,1145491200,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Being a third-person shooter, Quantum Break adds in some interesting time manipulation mechanics that make gameplay feel fun and unique. While the game is essentially a third-person cover shooter, it actively encourages to get out of cover and use these given powers. While you could technically you could play the game with just shooting, you wouldn't enjoy it as much and have as much fun.
The story in Quantum Break is interesting (I won't spoil it) and provides a great background for why the character has time manipulation powers. The plot is split into several episodes (the game is complete at launch), and there are very nice live-action cutscenes in between, each giving more background on the game world and especially fleshes out the villains even more. I really enjoyed the story in my time playing the game. There are decisions to be made, most of which affect the characters around you but these changes are subtle and could have had more of an impact. Disappointingly, there is only one ending available, and really makes the choices feel irrelevant. No matter what decisions you make, and even if they are different in each playthrough, the ending will always be the same, which might hinder replayability. Voice acting is very high quality, and that definitely makes the story even more interesting, as voice actors have strong performances delivering character dialogue.
The graphics in Quantum Break are excellent, there is lots of detail packed into characters' faces and everything around in the world. Particle effects are very beautiful and there is detailed real-time destruction in the environments and enemies can destroy cover easily but so can the player. Some parts of the environment actually react to main character's powers when using them, which is another nice touch I found.
The gameplay is pretty standard for a third-person action game with guns, and feels boring if only using cover shooting. You can't really even shoot from cover without standing up, which is quite disappointing, however the game never intended to be a generic shooter in the first place. You're encouraged to constantly move from place to place and use powers along with shooting and that is definitely the best way to play the game, as those powers are quite fun to use. In sections without shooting, Quantum Break has platforming challenges and exploration. It is interesting to explore these environments in search of more clues about characters and the world, while platforming can be sometimes a bit annoying but it all connects well together. The only issue with the gameplay is that the powers are given out way too early and there is no new gameplay introduced in the second half of the game, and you're stuck with using the same powers and so on, however, this is preference only and some people wouldn't even find this to be a problem.
The game also includes a copy of Alan Wake, which is also quite a good game and definitely worth playing through.
Quantum Break is a really great game, with a strong narrative, great actor performances, beautiful graphics and some fun action, however, some may find the game to be only good for one playthrough, as the story doesn't really differentiate between different decisions and the outcome is always the same, it is ultimately up to what you prefer.

Favorite Features:
1. Play Minecraft on your TV/PS3 in HD: Being able to use a big TV for Minecraft makes a real difference in enjoying the expansive terrains and various biomes.

2. Built in tutorials: Unlike older versions where you had to learn everything as you played or consult the internet, this console version includes a beginner tutorial to familiarize users with the basic actions in the game and controls.

3. SPLIT SCREEN!: This is by far my favorite feature. Being able to run around your world and build and create with someone sitting next to you adds a new aspect of fun to survival and creative games. It is great to play alone in your world then have a friend jump right in to help you build great structures, care for crops and livestock, or explore the virtually endless randomly generated world.

Least favorite features:

1. Not Cross platform: I know there must be technical issues to overcome but since this game is such a faithful recreation of vanilla Minecraft, I wish I could play with friends who have the XBOX or PC version. Unfortunately you cannot.

2. Console controls tough for some PC players: When my friend who loves PC Minecraft plays with me he is always complaining about the controls being so much better on PC. This may just be his preference.

3. No Modding: The PC version of Minecraft has every mod imaginable to change the way the game plays, from DAYZ survival style to Pokemon capturing. Unfortunately these are not available for console users.

Overall Minecraft is an incredible game that can be very satisfying and peaceful, and frantic and frustrating. This PS3 version has everything from the vanilla game so you can mine and craft on your console.

5.0,False,"04 1, 2005",A3L6S86HGO9OUW,B0000A09EP,Madisen,"I have a theory about games like these. My theory is that their developers have secret access to a mysterious element called Happy, which they tuck into the microchip before shipping the game. This causes the strange effect of players not being able to cease smiling as they play the game. I have fallen under the effects of Happy, and here's why.

I loved the look of this game. Clear, sharp, and colorful, with gorgeous animation. I highly reccomend that you play it on a DS or GBA SP, as the extra light heightens the graphics to glorious levels.

The battle system is wonderful. You may not be able to believe that the superb Paper Mario combat system would translate well to a handheld, but ah, how wrong you'd be. Timing the button presses takes concentration, but is never frustrating or boring. You can use hammers, jumps, or even magical powers to attack, as well as an array of fun items.

Then there are the puzzles. This is where the Happy element is in its strongest form. As you progress in the game, you'll earn new abilities, and each and every one will help you solve the near-perfect puzzles. Use your hammer to whack the brother in front of you into the ground...light your partner's pants on fire to make him dash...or jump on his head to reach a high ledge. Whatever it is you have to do, it always makes sense. For this reason, I would reccomend playing without a strategy guide, since using one would ruin the fun of figuring the puzzles out.

The story, which is beautiful in its simplicity, has many twists and turns, so you never know what you might be doing next. One minute you could be hunting for beans to make Yoshis lay eggs, and the next you might be strategically using your hammer to help a fashion designer dye her clothes. This keeps the game fresh and exciting at every turn.

RPG elements are integrated masterfully. You can gain experience, level up, and even buy new equipment. These features add to the game, but never become a pain.

From the beginning, which features Mario running around in his underwear, to the end sequence, wherein Bowser is tied to the back of a plane in a gigantic gift box, this game is pure joy. So play it already. Feel the Happy.",Pure joy,1112313600,3,,

I bought this bundle from a local store that is closing so I got it at a minor 10% discount(saved $30)...

The initial setup was time consuming but as long as you have a reliable ISP connection it all goes smoothly. The game pad takes about 3 hours to fully charge and it's all fairly easy to sync up.

I need to force myself to play a lengthy session of Mario to see if i encounter any overheating issues which some have experienced. I had purchased a couple of Wii games, RE remake and RE0 and tried that out, it's ok but sad that the Wii U doesn't upscale older games like the PS3 does. I haven't changed my dissappointment in Nintendo for forcing users to buy older Wii controllers to play Wii game...i had to at least buy a Wiimote to play RE remake and it's awkard so there you have it...I'll probably buy a classic controller just to enjoy those games=Nintendo's money pit in action, oh well :)

I'd give this 5/5 stars if Nintendo had allowed playing Wii games or any games with the new gamepad controller or any new Wii U controllers. To me that makes no sense to not be able to use the new controller for everything including older games. I know that's a cheap way for Nintendo to get additional sales and I'll never like that aspect of their business model.

EDIT: well I changed my rating to 5 instead of 4 because of the confusion over using the gamepad and swapping out for various controller types... I guess it's better to be able to use older controller to suit one's taste. But when you boot up the Wii U you can change directly to the Wii menu by holding down the B button, it still seems as though you need to use the Wii remote to get things started lol... I still don't know. I get my copy of RE4 Wii version soon so I'll experiment more.

The Wii U is a great system that's getting a lot of unjust negative press. So far I love it.",so far so good,1390348800,,,

5.0,True,"01 3, 2017",A34GO192229QFQ,B0186W6QG0,Dan S,"TL;DR version: The keyboard is great.  Colors are bright and smooth.  Cherry MX Browns feel great.  Very robust and durable feeling keyboard & wire. Decent updated software that's quick to learn and powerful.  Best (only right now) keyboard with these features for the price. Recommended.

I almost missed this keyboard as an option and was about to order a Corsair k95 RGB or k70 RGB.  Both were close to what I wanted, but not exactly.  I didn't want the huge footprint of the k95, but I wanted some macro buttons since I do play MMOs sometimes.  I didn't want Razer because of the poor quality control I've heard horror stories about from them, and at the same price they were missing dedicated media controls, something I wanted and had one few macro buttons.  I knew I wanted Cherry MX switches, so no Logitech.  Besides, their Romer G switches feel all mushy to me.  The long and the short of it is that there really isn't a keyboard on the market that ticked all my boxes til this one.  And to find that it sits $60 below all the competition?  Such a winner.

Only major complaint is to G.Skill: Why does the version with Blue switches have to cost $40 more? That's such a rip off.  I had wanted blue switches, but decided it wasn't worth the premium after trying my roommate's keyboard out with browns.  I still sort of wish I did by them, but browns are still a nice typing feel, and I guess slightly less straining due to lower actuation force.

Overall physically, it has good key placement, even for the gaming keys.  They feel natural to reach to, but there's just enough of a gap to where I don't find myself hitting them instead of the end column of the normal keyboard.  The board itself seems very solid from the metal rail running around it, and the thick braided cord is durable feeling and protected a bit by the rail as well.  I didn't think I'd use the mouse cord caddy, but it's actually pretty nice and helps to fight the pull of extra cord off the back of your desk.  The dedicated media controls are nice and on the fly macro recording is super intuitive.  Also, the included wrist rest is nice to have.  The molded texture on the top makes the lack of soft touch plastic much more acceptable and the fact that it attaches to the metal tube like all the other accessories is nice and secure.

The RGB lighting is good and really not that hard to set up.  I disagree with the amount of complaining people have with the software.  I guess G.Skill did an update since some of the early reviews, since things people mentioned specifically aren't a problem anymore.  So that shows G.Skill is working on improving their product.  While it's slightly more involved than clicking once on the effect you want and being done, if your computer ability is above IE and Office only, you're going to be more than capable of setting up simple lighting profiles.  More advanced stuff will take time, but the capabilities of the lighting tool are pretty impressive.  It would have been nice if they included the volume level and ""num lock"" ""caps lock"" and ""scroll lock"" indicators in the RGB scheme instead of static red, but they look okay as is.  Also, just having the volume level there is a nice touch.  Probably could have done with only one row of windows for it as the bottom one is lit and the other two above it just glow a little.",Best Keyboard you can buy,1483401600,5,{'Style:': ' Cherry MX Brown (RGB LED)'},

CONCEPT: The concept is simple, paint everything.

GRAPHICS: The graphics like all Wii games are last generation but well done and very suitable for what it is. It could benefit from more colors and patterns.

MUSIC: The music is kind of a jazzy funky mix and very well done.

CONTROLS: I've never really loved the innovative Wii controllers. Give me an Xbox 360 or PS3 controller any day. However, the Wii controller is very simple and easy to use.

It's all tied together with a cute story, and it received good to great reviews in the game magazines.

I noticed Best Buy sells it with a free T-shirt. Circuit City has a free game soundtrack CD included. Target has a mini-comic book included. I don't think Amazon is including any extras. I purchased from Circuit City for the music CD. I'm not sure how long the free items will be available.

The game is appropriate for younger players, starting about 5 years old and up, depending on how much you help. The game is interesting and challenging enough that players of ANY age would enjoy it.

I often try to play new games over so many weeks and resell them while they still have good resell value, but so far, this game seems to be a keeper.

Let's get the bad stuff out of the way.  My problems with the system are not with its performance, but rather with the relocation of certain things. The game card slot, stylus and power buttons have all been moved to the bottom of the system, when usually they were either at the side, inside or the top. This is a very important thing to know because depending on how you hold your system the palm of your hands may accidentally press the power button, or worse, pull out the game card. This is just a bad decision that obligates you to rethink how to properly hold your system without shutting it off by mistake.

There's also the fact that this 3DS does not include a charger. Personally it doesn't affect me as I have about 3 other chargers that work with it. (All chargers since the DSi XL work will all subsequent Nintendo portables) But I would understand if you were a new owner and were upset to find out it didn't include one.

With that said, the New 3DS XL is the best version of the 3DS. The 3D effect alone is a major step up from the older versions, it actually makes the effect more enjoyable and less painful to see. It has a slightly better CPU which improves the performance on its own interface as well as on several games. This to be honest is one of my favorite things about this revision. It makes the menu and app switching a less painful experience. Other improvements are the additional shoulder buttons, and the amiibo support which depending on who you are, it's either a neat addition or a useless addition. There's also a C Stick added which.. to be honest it works fine but doesn't feel as comfortable as a C Stick should. But it's there.  The system itself also has a sexier smoother look, versus the more toyish look of all other versions.

This is the definitive version of the 3DS and I would fully recommend getting one if you love playing on the go. The 3DS has a fantastic game library so you really can't go wrong with it.","Despite a few odd design choices, still the best 3DS you could own.",1482278400,,"{'Configuration:': ' without AC Adapter', 'Edition:': ' Black'}",

Headphones came with all cables needed for use with major gaming consoles.

Compatibility:
There is a dongle that you have to plug into your controller.  For PS3 and PS4 there shouldn't be any problem using these as wireless headphones. There is a dongle you run into the USB port on the Playstation system, and you use the optical audio port (with a provided cable), and you're in business.

But for Xbox One, whether its completely wireless depends on what you are going to do.  If you just want to use it for listening to game audio, then they will be completely wireless and work as described above.  But, if you want to use them for voice chat in game, you are going to have connect the headphones to your controller with a wire.

If you want to use voice chat on Xbox one, there is another detail.  Check your controller for a phono jack.  If it has one, then you are in good shape.  But if your Xbox controller has a square plug (not a round one) you are going to have to buy an adapter to be able to do voice chat.  This is the adapter you will need:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xbox-One-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/dp/B00IAVDOS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter</a>&nbsp;Its $24.95 at the time of this writing.

I had to buy the adapter, and once I did, it worked great.

The Microphone is on a flexible wire, so you can shape it to fit and work well for you - a nice alternative to a rigid mike which might not have best placement.

Sound directionality was good overall - it was a lot easier to gauge positions of sound cues than through standard tv speakers

Ring dial controls placed on the cans made adjusting volume and equalizer very easy to do, even mid-game.  I really liked this design.  You can adjust volume on the left ear and equalizer on the right ear.  Its a really great idea.

5.0,False,"12 1, 2002",A2VJJ2POCLMED7,B00005QDPZ,Marshall Carter,"Overview: As a long-time Star Wars fan, I've always loved to try the newest Star Wars game. From the original vector-based Star Wars Arcade game on, there's just something about being able to tap into an universe that you're already familiar with. Unfortunately, like many licensed titles, these have been hit and miss over the years, though the hits have been many on Nintendo consoles. Rogue Leader is no exception, setting a new mark for excellence in a Star Wars game. While fans of the more technical TIE and X-Wing shooters on the PC might find this a step down as far as gameplay is concerned, most Star Wars fans will come to the agreement that no game has captured Star Wars so well visually. No other early GameCube game comes close to the visual splendor to be found, and very few play as well to boot.
Graphics: 10.0  One word sums up Rogue Leader's graphical prowess: AMAZING! No game I've seen on any platform has caught me more by surprise than the graphical beast that is the Rogue Leader engine. While I suppose that I shouldn't be all that surprised, Factor 5 did some great work on the Nintendo 64 after all (Rogue Squadron & Indiana Jones & the Infernal Machine in particular), I suppose that I just wasn't prepared for the leap they were able to take from the Nintendo 64. Not only are the ship models extremely accurate to their motion picture counterparts (I've read specs that state that they're actually MORE detailed than the 3D models used in the Special Editions), but the textures are top-notch. The level of detail is also amazing. Not only have the environments from the films been effectively recreated (one might argue that some even look better), but the little things, such as stormtroopers running around and turbolasers firing in the distance as far as the eye can see, convince you at times that you are actually there. Via the GameCube, Factor 5 has basically accomplished in real time what fans have been wanting for years...a chance to PLAY the movie. Sure, I might be exaggerating just a bit, but I will not be guilty of underrating Rogue Leaders visuals; they are that good. Besides, as a long-time fan of the classic Trilogy (hey, I've played the Atari computer version of Star Wars Arcade!), you'll forgive me for that. Impressive...

Sound: 9.5  If you've ever watched a Star Wars movie, you'll know what to expect here. The sound effects, voice-overs and John Williams' trademark soundtrack are all here, and in fine fashion. Thanks to the mini-DVD medium, a Star Wars game on a Nintendo system has never been better. In the advent of the surround-sound home theater, Rogue Leader's ProLogic II surround sound is also welcome. While you have to have a newer receiver to be able to take full advantage of the format, it still sounds very good on my older ProLogic receiver, so good in fact that you can hear the TIE's coming up from behind. It's hard for a game that LOOKS this good to blow you away in the sound area, but let me be the first to say, that Rogue Leader *ALMOST* pulls it off. Most impressive...
Gameplay: 8.0  Where many licensed games fall short is the area of gameplay, and there has been more than one Star Wars game to fall prey to that trend. Fortunately, Rogue Leader manages to play extremely well: controls are well-laid out and responsive, while the design, which can be difficult, never seems that overwhelmingly difficult. That being said, there is very little new here. It's basically Rogue Squadron with better graphics after all. Right? Not quite... While the play mechanics of the original are basically unchanged, there are two areas that have been improved upon GREATLY: 1) SPEED & 2) AI. In Rogue Squadron, there were points in the game where you just felt like your X-Wing was literally CRAWLING across the sky. You won't have that sensation here. While your ship still never seems to move as fast as you need it to (remember, the TIE's are faster than just about anything the Rebellion has...even the A-Wings can't quite do it), the sensation of speed is there, particularly when skimming over the surface of a Star Destroyer or some other large-scale obstacle. As for the AI, I'm not so much referring to the forces of the Empire as I am your fellow Rogue Squadron members. You can't depend on them to do all the work, but their reactions to your commands are responsive, as you can actually see them doing the order you just issued.
Theme: 10.0  This is a Star Wars game, and if that says anything, it's that there are thousands of (rabid?) fans waiting for more realistic immersion into the Star Wars universe than games have allowed. While Star Wars Galaxies promises role-playing in the classic Star Wars universe early next year, no game captures the speed and epic scale of the space battles of the Star Wars films like Rogue Leader does right now. The scale of the game, the size of the Star Destroyers and Death Star, the swarms of TIE Fighters, it truly is one aspect of the Star Wars experience on a grand scale. With the space expansion of Star Wars Galaxies well over a year away, no other title puts you there like this. You'd need your own astromech droid for it to be any more convincing.
Overall: 9.5  While launch titles are almost never considered to be representative of what a hardware platform is capable of, it's hard not to think that Factor 5 has been able to tap into the GameCube's capabilities at an unrivalled degree. By staying with the formula that had proven successful on the N64 with Rogue Squadron (and the lest touted Battle for Naboo), Factor 5 has been able to refine the gameplay for a game that's ultimately very easy to just pick up and play, but difficult enough to master. Perhaps the biggest compliment that can be given to the game though, is that once you have mastered it, you might just want to take it for another spin, if only to take in all the beautiful scenery.",As close to being on Hoth as you'll ever get...,1038700800,14,,
